Publishing Firm Hires @ Financial Adviser @ To Weigh Alternatives 11/01/89 WALL STREET JOURNAL (J) PSSP EARNINGS (ERN) TENDER OFFERS, MERGERS, ACQUISITIONS (TNM) LOS ANGELES


Price Stern Sloan Inc. said#e1 it hired#e2 an investment banking firm to assist#e4 in evaluating#e5 restructuring or merger alternatives and reported#e6 a net loss#e7 of $8.1 million, or $2.14 a share, for the#t41 third#t41 quarter#t41 ended Sept.#t42 30#t42.

These results compare#e62 with net income of $1.8 million, or 44 cents a share, for the#t46 corresponding#t46 period#t46 last#t46 year#t46. This#t47 quarter#t47's loss#e11 includes pretax charges#e13 of $4.9 million on the proposed discontinuation of the company's troubled British subsidiary, and $3.7 million of other write-offs the company said#e17 were non-recurring and principally related to inventory, publishing advances and pre-publication costs. The publishing concern said#e21 it retained#e22 the investment banking firm of Donaldson, Lufkin amp Jenrette Securities Inc. to act#e23 as its financial adviser, assisting#e24 in the evaluation#e25 of various financial and strategic alternatives, including debt refinancing, raising capital, recapitalization, a merger or sale of the company.

The company also retained#e30 attorney Martin P. Levin, a director of the company and former head of the Times-Mirror Publishing Group, as an adviser.

Net sales for this#t49 year's#t49 third#t49 quarter#t49 were $14 million, down from $21.4 million last#t53 year#t53. The company attributed#e31 the decrease#e32 in part to the exclusion of the company's British sales from the current year's figures as a result of the subsidiary's status as a proposed discontinued operation and, in part, to lower sales in certain key foreign and domestic accounts. U.K. sales#e3000 for last#t58 year's#t58 quarter#t58 were about $3 million.
