The portfolio unit of the French bank group Credit Lyonnais told#e1 stock market regulators that it bought#e2 43,000 shares of Cie. de Navigation Mixte, apparently to help#e3 fend#e4 off an unwelcome takeover bid for the company.

Earlier#t23 yesterday#t23, the Societe de Bourses Francaises was told#e6 that a unit of Framatome S.A. also bought#e7 Navigation Mixte shares, this purchase#e8 covering more than 160,000 shares.

Both companies are allies of Navigation Mixte in its fight#e24 against a hostile takeover bid launched#e13 last#t61 week#t61 by Cie. Financiere de Paribas at 1,850 French francs ($297) a share. Navigation Mixte's chairman had suggested#e14 that friendly institutions were likely to buy#e16 its stock as soon as trading#e17 opened#e18 Monday#t26.

The Credit Lyonnais purchase, for 33,000 regular common shares and 10,000 newly created shares, is valued at about slightly more than 80 million French francs.
