IMA Holdings Corp. completed#e1 its $3 billion acquisition#e2 of American Medical International Inc., purchasing#e3 63 million shares, or 86%, of the Los Angeles-based health-care services concern for $26.50 a share. The price also includes assumption of about $1.4 billion in debt.

IMA is a group that includes First Boston Corp. and the Pritzker family of Chicago through the leveraged buy-out fund Harry Gray Melvyn Klein amp Partners. Harry J. Gray and Melvyn N. Klein, along with five other IMA designees, were named#e9 to join#e11 American Medical's 10-member board.

The completion#e12 of the merger agreement#e13 follows months#t91 of twists#e15 and turns#e16. In January#t93, American Medical brought#e17 in a new chief executive officer, Richard A. Gilleland, 45, who will remain#e18 as chairman, president and chief executive. A#t96 few#t96 days#t96 later, American Medical announced#e19 sharply lower earnings, taking#e20 charges of $24 million for insurance reserves and canceled real estate leases.

In March#t97, American Medical received#e23 a $24-a-share offer#e24 to take#e26 the company private from an investor group including large holder M. Lee Pearce. It also was considering#e28 a restructuring#e80 to help#e30 boost#e31 the stock price. A group including several members of the the Bass family of Texas urged#e32 the company to take#e34 some steps to maximize#e36 shareholder value.

The#t98 following#t98 month#t98, the company put#e37 itself up for sale. It received#e39 more offers#e40, but the auction#e41 was surprisingly won#e42 by IMA, which bid#e43 $28 a share and asked#e44 Mr. Gilleland to stay#e84 on as an equity participant. He indicated#e47 that some assets might be sold#e48 off to service#e51 the debt.

Then, after extending#e53 its offer four times waiting#e55 for a congressional tax ruling#e56, IMA early#t99 this#t99 month#t99 lowered#e57 its offer#e3000 to $26.50 a share amid turbulence in the junk bond market. American Medical accepted the offer, meanwhile indicating#e63 it had heard#e64 from two other suitors. But they never materialized#e65 and IMA completed#e66 the purchase#e67 yesterday#t100.

Other new board members include John S. Harrison and Mark A. Adley of First Boston, James F. Lyons, William S. Goldberg and Harold S. Handelsman.
