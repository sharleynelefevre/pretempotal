OAU to investigate Rwandan genocide


ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP)_ The Organization of African Unity said#e2 Friday#t41 it would investigate#e3 the Hutu-organized genocide#e4 of more than 500,000 minority Tutsis in Rwanda nearly#t42 four#t42 years#t42 ago#t42. Foreign ministers of member-states meeting#e5 in the Ethiopian capital agreed#e6 to set#e7 up a seven-member panel to investigate#e8 who shot#e9 down Rwandan President Juvenal Habyarimana's plane on April#t43 6,#t43 1994#t43. The assassination#e10 touched#e11 off a murderous rampage#e12 by Hutu security forces and civilians, who slaughtered#e14 mainly Tutsis but also Hutus who favored#e15 reconciliation#e16 with the minority. It also reignited#e17 the civil war#e18. The panel also will look#e19 at the exodus#e20 of about 2 million Rwanda Hutus to neighboring countries where they lived#e22 in U.N.-run refugee camps for 2#t44 1/2#t44 years#t44. The investigation#e24 will consider#e25 the role of ``internal and external forces prior to the genocide#e27 and subsequently, and the role of the United Nations and its agencies and the OAU before, during and after the genocide#e29,'' the OAU said#e30. The panel will be based#e31 in Addis Ababa, and will finish#e32 its investigation#e33 within a#t45 year#t45, it said#e34. It is to be funded#e35 by voluntary contributions from within and outside the continent. (aa-kjd)
