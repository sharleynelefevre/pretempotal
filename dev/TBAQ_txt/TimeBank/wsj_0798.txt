Hudson's Bay Co. announced#e1 terms of a previously proposed rights issue that is expected#e2 to raise#e4 about 396 million Canadian dollars (US$337 million) net of expenses.

Canada's largest department store operator said#e13 the rights offering will entitle#e15 holders of its ordinary shares, except residents in the U.S. and Britain, to subscribe#e17 for two additional shares for every five shares held at a price of C$31.25 a share. The record date is Nov.#t50 9#t50.

The company has#e21 about 31 million ordinary shares outstanding. On the Toronto Stock Exchange, Hudson's Bay shares closed#e22 at C$35, up 12.5 cents.
