Investor Group Makes @ Bid for Dataproducts; @ Liquidation Is Sought 10/30/89 WALL STREET JOURNAL (J) DPC TENDER OFFERS, MERGERS, ACQUISITIONS (TNM) WOODLAND HILLS, Calif.


A unit of DPC Acquisition Partners launched#e1 a $10-a-share tender offer#e2 for the shares outstanding of Dataproducts Corp., and said#e3 it would seek#e4 to liquidate#e7 the computer-printer maker "as#t80 soon#t80 as#t80 possible#t80," even if a merger#e82 isn't consummated#e10.

DPC Acquisition is controlled by Crescott Investment Associates, Wilson Investment Group, Kernel Corp. and Catalyst Partners. The investor group owns 1,534,600 Dataproducts common shares, or a 7.6% stake.

The offer#e15 is based on several conditions, including obtaining#e84 financing#e85. DPC Acquisition said#e18 it had received#e19 the reasonable assurance of Chase Manhattan Bank N.A. that the financing#e21 can be obtained#e22.

In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, DPC Acquisition said#e25 it expects#e26 it will need#e27 about $215 million to buy#e29 the shares and pay#e30 related fees and expenses. DPC Acquisition added#e32 that it has not begun#e33 discussions#e35 with financing sources, and said#e36 it expected#e37 to repay#e39 the amounts borrowed#e40 through proceeds of the liquidation#e42.

Dataproducts officials declined#e43 to comment#e45, and said#e46 they had not yet seen#e47 a suit filed#e50 in federal court by DPC Acquisition that seeks#e52 to nullify#e54 a standstill agreement#e55 between DPC Acquisition and Dataproducts.

Earlier#t86 this#t86 year#t86, DPC Acquisition made#e56 a $15-a-share offer#e57 for Dataproducts, which the Dataproducts board said#e58 it rejected#e59 because the $283.7 million offer was not fully financed#e61. Dataproducts has since started#e64 a restructuring#e88, and has said#e65 it is not for#e90 sale.
