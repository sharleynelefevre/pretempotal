JERUSALEM (AP)_#e1 Taking#e1 the stand in her own defense, a friend of Yitzhak Rabin's assassin said#e2 Friday#t70 that she regretted#e3 calling#e4 the prime minister a traitor and praying#e8 for his death#e9. Margalit Har-Shefi, 22, has pleaded#e10 innocent to charges#e12 that she failed#e13 to report#e15 Yigal Amir's plan#e16 to kill#e17 Rabin. She took#e18 the stand for more#t71 than#t71 four#t71 hours#t71 Friday#t72 in a Tel Aviv magistrate's court. Amir, 27, is serving#e19 a life sentence for the November#t73 1995#t73 assassination#e20 of Rabin at a Tel Aviv peace rally#e21. Newspaper reports have said#e22 Amir was infatuated#e23 with Har-Shefi and may have been trying#e24 to impress#e25 her by killing#e26 the prime minister. Har-Shefi acknowledged#e27 she told#e28 police interrogators that Rabin was a traitor#e29 and that she prayed#e30 for him to have a heart attack and die#e34. She said#e35 Rabin's murder#e36 was ``a black stain on Israel,'' Israel radio and Israel army radio reported#e37. Har-Shefi said#e38 she heard#e39 Amir talk#e40 about killing#e41 Rabin but did not tell#e42 the police because she did not believe#e43 he was serious#e44. Instead, she turned#e45 to her community rabbi in the Jewish West Bank settlement of Beit El and told#e46 him about Amir's statements. The rabbi said#e48 called#e49 the talk#e50 about killing#e51 Rabin ``nonsense,'' and said#e53 Jews are prohibited#e54 from killing one another, the radio reports said#e56. Har-Shefi described#e57 Amir as an ``original thinker,'' as well as delusional and a liar. She also denied#e58 accusations#e59 made#e60 by Amir's brother, Hagai, that she joined#e61 an anti-Arab underground movement. She said#e62 she gave#e63 the Amir brothers false information regarding the location of a weapons and ammunition cache when they asked#e64 her to help#e65 organize#e66 such a movement.
