ea980120.1830.0071 NEWS STORY


Good evening from the central park in downtown Havana. We are here#e116 this#t53 week#t53 to witness#e61 the rendezvous#e62 that Fidel Castro and the Pope are having with history.

We are here#e117 because what happens#e3 on this island will also have an impact#e4 on the United States. Everything that happens in Cuba gets America's attention.

Incidentally, we just show up to do the broadcast#e65, and Cubans want#e8 to know#e9 what we're going to tell#e11 Americans, in many cases, what their relatives in the United States are going to hear#e15.

Well, this is the eve of the Pope's visit#e66 to one of the last bastions of Communism anywhere in the world, and it is already causing#e16 enormous expectations.

In Revolution Square, they put#e17 up a giant cross today#t59. And right across from the Cuban revolutionary icon Che Guevara, they now#t56 have a giant portrait of Jesus. Above it in Spanish, Jesus, in you we believe#e3000.

Not all Cubans believe, but Castro has invited#e23 everyone to welcome#e24 the man who has been one of Communism's most effective adversaries, and that's why there is suspense.

Everyone appears#e25 to believe#e26 that somehow Cuba is going to change#e28. Castro has said#e29 officially that it's okay to be enthusiastic#e3001. And so, people are increasingly enthusiastic by today#t68, Cuban television, which clings to the Communist Party line, actually began#e31 to promote#e32 its papal coverage#e70.

Today#t57, hundreds of people from the US began#e33 to arrive#e34, including some Cuban Americans who left#e36 here when Castro came#e38 to power and are returning#e40 to Havana for the first time. The Pope's visit#e72 is important, but they are also coming#e41 home.

This is quite an extraordinary story#e42 unfolding#e43 here. We'll come#e44 back to Havana later in the broadcast#e46.

But now#t58 we're going to go#e49 back to New York, where Diane Sawyer has the rest of the news. Diane?
