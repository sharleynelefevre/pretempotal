The Persian Gulf showdown#e199 between Iraq and the United States took#e1 a more personal turn Thursday#t288 when Iraq's Saddam Hussein called#e3 President Bush a liar and said#e4 the outbreak of holy war#e202 could bring#e5 thousands of Americans home in coffins. Bush, commenting#e7 on the two-week#t289 gulf crisis#e8 from his vacation home in Maine, said#e11 he saw#e12 little reason to be optimistic#e205 about a settlement#e206 of the dispute#e207, which stems#e13 from Iraq's invasion#e208 of oil-wealthy Kuwait and its subsequent military buildup#e209 on the border of Saudi Arabia. After a two-hour#t290 meeting#e210 at his Kennebunkport home with King Hussein of Jordan, Bush said#e14, ``I did not come#e15 away with any feeling of hope'' that Iraq would withdraw#e17 its army from Kuwait. Bush also said#e19 Thursday#t291 that King Hussein assured#e20 him Jordan would close#e21 the last remaining free port to most Iraqi trade as the economic embargo#e213 on materials to Iraq continued#e25 unabated. Foodstuffs are among the goods being blocked#e26 from entry; Iraq imports about three-quarters of its food. Pentagon sources in Washington meanwhile said#e29 the Bush administration plans#e216 to deploy#e30 45,000 Marines to the region to back#e217 up the thousands of Army, Navy and Air Force troops already in place in the gulf and the Saudi desert. At a news conference#e220, Secretary of State James A. Baker III said#e32 Jordan `` is seeking#e33 some guidance'' about a provision in the U.N.-backed trade embargo that allows#e35 food for humanitarian purposes. Worries however grew#e36 about the safety of Americans and other Westerners trapped#e37 in Kuwait. Iraqi military authorities ordered#e38 all Americans and Britons in Kuwait to assemble#e39 at a hotel, officials said#e40. ``Very few'' of the 2,500 Americans in occupied Kuwait complied#e41 with the order, a senior U.S. official told#e42 The Associated Press. Iraq said#e43 the roundup#e225 was to protect#e44 them from unspecified threats#e45; British Foreign Office minister William Waldegrave called#e47 the order ``grave and sinister.'' ``What we fear#e227 is that they will be interned#e48 somewhere, most likely in Iraq,'' Waldegrave said#e49. A total of about 3,000 Americans, 3,000 Britons and more than 450 Japanese are in Iraq and Kuwait. Overall, more than 2 million foreigners are in both countries. Iraq has called them ``restrictees.'' In addition to the estimated 45,000 Marines to ultimately be part of Operation Desert Shield, Stealth fighter planes and the aircraft carrier John F. Kennedy are also headed#e51 to Saudi Arabia to protect#e52 it from Iraqi expansionism. In Washington, Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams said#e53 Iraq has continued#e54 to increase#e55 its armed forces in Kuwait and they now#t316 number about 160,000. Saddam has been under international quarantine since his Aug.#t292 2#t292 power-grab#e239, or what he calls#e56 an ``eternal merger#e1507'' with Kuwait. In a long verbal attack#e237 read on Iraqi television Thursday#t293, Saddam repeatedly called#e57 Bush ``a liar'' and said#e58 a shooting war#e242 could produce#e59 body bags courtesy of Baghdad. ``We continue#e61 to pray#e320 and pray#e63 hard to God so that there will be no confrontation#e64 whereby you will receive#e65 thousands of Americans wrapped in sad coffins after you had pushed#e67 them into a dark tunnel,'' Saddam said#e69. He called#e70 U.S. soldiers massing#e71 in Saudi Arabia the real occupiers in the Persian Gulf. Replied#e72 State Department deputy spokesman Richard Boucher, ``We haven't really analyzed#e73 the statement in detail but it appears#e76 to be just another example of his outlandish rhetoric and his attempts#e246 to distort#e77 the truth. ``We believe#e78 that his words cannot distract#e80 the world from the facts of Iraqi aggression.'' An international land, sea and air force has mobilized#e83 since Iraq's invasion#e249, which was sparked#e84 by disputes#e250 over oil, land and repayment of war loans. In the largest U.S. military operation#e251 since Vietnam, an estimated 20,000 American GIs have already massed#e85 to defend#e86 Saudi Arabia. ``We don't just arrive#e87,'' said#e89 four-star Gen. John Dailey, assistant commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps. ``We're there to stay#e90 for a#t339 fairly#t339 lengthy#t339 period#t339.'' Egypt, Syria, Morocco and Bangladesh also committed#e91 ground troops, to a much lesser degree. The U.S. Navy has#e253 27 ships in the maritime barricade of Iraq. They are aided#e254 by Britain, West Germany, Australia, Canada, the Netherlands and Belgium. Bush was expected#e95 to authorize#e96 naval commanders to use#e97 ``the minimum force necessary'' to interdict#e98 shipments to and from Iraq, a U.S. official said#e99. That could include firing#e255 across the bow to halt#e256 a ship. In the air, U.S. Air Force fliers say#e102 they have engaged#e103 in ``a little cat and mouse'' with Iraqi warplanes, which have retreated#e104 when weapons radar locks#e257 onto them. ``They don't want#e107 to play#e109 with us,'' one U.S. crew chief said#e110. In Kuwait, the Iraqis have rimmed#e111 the capital city with an air-defense system, according#e258 to a U.S. official who spoke on the condition of anonymity. He declined#e114 to say#e115 if the weapons included#e117 missiles, but the Iraqis have them in their arsenal. The Iraqis also possess chemical weapons. The combined operations#e1138 are designed to isolate#e122 and strangle#e259 Iraq until it retreats#e123 from Kuwait. The quarantine hopes#e125 to staunch#e126 the flow#e261 of Iraqi oil, which is Iraq's economic lifeblood, and clamp#e127 down on food and supplies going#e128 in. Iraq now#t295 controls#e129 20 percent of the world's oil reserves with its conquest#e262 of Kuwait. Only Saudi Arabia has#e263 more oil reserves. The economic chokehold#e1214 appears to be working. The Lloyd's List International newspaper, which monitors worldwide shipping, said#e134 Iraq's fleet of 80 tankers and cargo ships has stopped#e135 regular trading#e136. John Prescott, a shipping correspondent, said#e137 there was no shipping#e138 in Kuwaiti or Iraqi ports and that activity was trailing#e139 off in the Jordanian port of Aqaba. Bush's chief objective in his meeting#e140 with Hussein was to press#e266 the king to shut#e142 down Iraq's food and oil supply route from Aqaba on the Red Sea. Aqaba is Iraq's only outlet#e267 now#t299 that an international noose has tightened#e143. Bush has indicated#e144 the U.S. Navy will barricade#e145 the port from Iraqi ships. The president also has offered#e147 to help#e148 offset#e149 Jordan's costs because 40 percent of its exports go#e1307 to Iraq and 90 percent of its oil comes#e1306 from there. ``It's our only outlet to the sea and the rest of the world,'' Hussein said#e152. He also said#e153 of trade with Iraq: ``There are no shipments at the moment.'' A#t352 day#t352 earlier#t352, scores of trucks, many with Iraqi license plates, streamed#e156 north out of Aqaba to Amman and onto the desert highway bound for Iraq. The Jordanian monarch met#e158 this#t300 week#t300 with Saddam, but he told#e159 reporters he had no message from Baghdad. ``I am not talking#e161 on behalf of anyone in the area... but myself,'' Hussein said#e165. In the United Nations, Libya called#e166 for the replacement#e271 of U.S. forces in the Persian Gulf with Arab League forces and U.N. soldiers. Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi, in a letter to the U.N. Secretary-General, also called#e169 for an emergency Security Council meeting#e272 in Geneva to remove#e170 U.S. forces. There was no decision#e171 on a meeting#e173. Thirty-two of the 159 U.N. members had filed#e175 compliance reports by Wednesday#t301, and all were honoring#e274 the sanctions Iraq. Also Thursday#t302, Saudi Arabia called#e177 for an emergency conference#e276 of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to discuss#e178 how much oil to pump#e179. The minister denied#e180 the kingdom had notified#e3000 notified any of its customers of any cutbacks#e278 in oil supply. Reports attributed to the Japanese foreign ministry said#e185 Saudi Arabia told#e186 U.S., European and Japanese oil companies of a 15-20 percent cutback#e279 in its oil supply in September#t303. Meanwhile, Egypt's official Middle East News Agency said#e188 Thursday#t304 that Saddam was the target#e189 of an assassination attempt#e280, which led#e190 to ``large-scale'' arrests#e282, including some close associates of the Iraqi strongman. The agency quoted#e192 witnesses as saying#e193 tanks and armored cars are patrolling#e283 the streets of Baghdad. There was no independent confirmation#e194 of the report by the government-run news agency, which did not say#e195 when the reported attempt#e286 occurred#e198.
