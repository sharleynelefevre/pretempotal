American Ritter resumes inspections in Iraq

BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP)_ An American leader of a U.N. weapons inspection team resumed#e1 work#e2 in Iraq Friday#t138, nearly#t139 two#t139 months#t139 after his team was effectively blocked#e4. Scott Ritter led#e5 his team on a 10-hour#t140 tour#e6 of three suspected weapons sites classified as ``sensitive'' by the Iraqi authorities, U.N. spokesman Alan Dacey said#e9. ``All sites were inspected#e10 to the satisfaction of the inspection team and with full cooperation of Iraqi authorities,'' Dacey said#e12. At least one of the sensitive sites was a barracks of the elite Republican Guard, a well-placed source told The Associated Press. Previously#t1191 the Iraqis have resisted#e14 attempts#e15 to inspect#e17 such quarters. The U.N. Security Council has charged#e18 the inspectors with verifying#e19 that Iraq has destroyed#e20 its long-range missiles and weapons of mass destruction. It was the first time that Ritter, who arrived#e24 Thursday#t141 with some 50 inspectors for a tour#e25 likely to last#e27 over#t143 a#t143 week#t143, had been allowed#e28 to carry#e30 out an inspection#e31 since Jan.#t1192 13#t1192. Then the Baghdad government stopped#e32 providing#e33 Ritter's team with escorts, making#e35 it impossible for him to enter#e37 any site. Iraq alleged#e38 Ritter was an American spy whose team had a disproportionately high number of Americans and Britons. The official Iraqi News Agency, which gives the daily#t1000 tally of inspections, did not mention#e42 Ritter by name, but said#e45 Friday#t144 that team no. 225 _ which Ritter heads _ made#e48 surprise visits#e49 to a number of sites and was assisted#e50 by aerial surveillance. Five other U.N. inspection teams visited#e52 a total of nine other sites, the agency reported#e53. An Iraqi official, speaking#e54 on customary condition of anonymity, said#e56 Ritter would not try#e57 to visit#e61 any of the eight presidential sites that Baghdad had placed#e62 off-limits to U.N. weapons inspectors. The official said#e63 these sites could only be visited#e64 by a special team of U.N. monitors and diplomats as laid#e67 down by the Feb.#t1193 23#t1193 accord signed#e68 by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan and Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz. Ritter's return#e69 is seen#e70 as something of a test#e71 of that agreement, under which Iraq agreed#e73 to give#e75 inspectors full access to eight of Saddam Hussein's presidential palaces. The United States had moved#e76 additional troops and a naval armada into the Gulf and said#e77 it would strike#e78 Iraq unless it gave the U.N. arms inspectors unfettered access to all potential weapons sites, including Saddam's palaces. Iraq had argued#e80 the presidential sites should be off limits as symbols of sovereignty. A Pentagon spokesman said#e83 Thursday#t146 that the 38,000 U.S. troops in the Gulf will remain#e84 until Iraq complies#e157 with the U.N. Security Council agreement over weapons inspections. ``We are going to maintain#e88 our forces in the region for the foreseeable future,'' said#e89 spokesman Kenneth Bacon. The U.N.-Iraq accord was worked#e90 out by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who appointed#e91 a retired Indian diplomat on Thursday#t1194 as his special representative to Iraq. Prakash Shah, 58, a former Indian ambassador to the United Nations, is part of an effort#e159 by Annan to expand#e94 contacts with the Iraqi leadership. Palace inspections#e97 are not expected#e98 to start#e101 until the new agreement's procedures are in place. U.N. officials in New York on Friday#t148 finished#e106 drafting#e107 the rules, in consultation with Iraqi diplomats. The procedures are due to go#e112 before the Security Council next#t150 week#t150. The Security Council has said#e113 it will not lift#e114 the sweeping sanctions imposed#e117 on Iraq after its 1990#t151 invasion#e118 of Kuwait until the U.N. inspectors certify#e121 that Baghdad has eliminated#e122 its weapons of mass destruction.
