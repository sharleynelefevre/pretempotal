Who's News: @ Magna International's @ Financial Chief Quits; @ Chairman Stepping In 11/02/89 WALL STREET JOURNAL (J) MAGAF WNEWS TORONTO


Magna International Inc.'s chief financial officer, James McAlpine, resigned#e1 and its chairman, Frank Stronach, is stepping#e2 in to help#e5 turn#e60 the automotive-parts manufacturer around, the company said#e6.

Mr. Stronach will direct#e7 an effort#e8 to reduce#e10 overhead and curb#e11 capital spending#e12 "until a more satisfactory level of profit is achieved#e14 and maintained#e15," Magna said#e16.

Stephen Akerfeldt, currently vice president finance, will succeed#e19 Mr. McAlpine.

An ambitious expansion#e20 has left#e21 Magna with excess capacity and a heavy debt load as the automotive industry enters#e23 a downturn#e24. The company has reported#e25 declines#e62 in operating profit in each#t180 of#t180 the#t180 past#t180 three#t180 years#t180, despite steady sales growth#e187.

Magna recently#t66 cut#e27 its quarterly dividend in half and the company's Class A shares are wallowing#e29 far below their 52-week#t68 high#e67 of 16.125 Canadian dollars (US$13.73). On the Toronto Stock Exchange yesterday#t69, Magna shares closed#e30 up 37.5 Canadian cents to C$9.625.

Mr. Stronach, founder and controlling shareholder of Magna, resigned#e32 as chief executive officer last#t228 year#t228 to seek#e59, unsuccessfully, a seat in Canada's Parliament.

Analysts said#e35 Mr. Stronach wants#e36 to resume#e38 a more influential role in running#e41 the company. They expect#e42 him to cut#e44 costs throughout the organization.

The company said#e45 Mr. Stronach will personally direct#e46 the restructuring#e289, assisted#e47 by Manfred Gingl, president and chief executive. Neither they nor Mr. McAlpine could be reached#e48 for comment.

Magna said#e51 Mr. McAlpine resigned#e52 to pursue#e54 a consulting career, with Magna as one of his clients.
