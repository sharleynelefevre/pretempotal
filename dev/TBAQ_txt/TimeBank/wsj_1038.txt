Benjamin Franklin Federal Savings amp Loan Association said#e1 it plans#e2 to restructure#e4 in the wake of a third-quarter#t59 loss#e6 of $7.7 million, or $1.01 a share, reflecting#e7 an $11 million addition#e8 to loan-loss reserves.

The Portland, Ore., thrift said#e9 the restructuring should help#e10 it meet#e12 new capital standards from the Financial Institution Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act. A#t96 year#t96 ago#t96, Benjamin Franklin had profit#e14 of $1.8 million, or 23 cents a share.

The company said#e17 the restructuring's initial phase will feature#e18 a gradual reduction in assets and staff positions. The plan#e131 may include#e20 selling#e22 branches, consolidating#e23 or eliminating departments, and winding#e25 down or disposing#e26 of unprofitable units within#t140 18#t140 months#t140.

Initially, the company said#e27 it will close#e28 its commercial real-estate lending division, and stop#e29 originating#e30 new leases at its commercial lease subsidiary.

Details of the restructuring won't be made#e31 final until regulators approve#e34 the regulations mandated#e36 by the new federal act, the company said#e38.
