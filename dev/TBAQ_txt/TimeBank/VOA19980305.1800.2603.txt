International Women's Day is this#t66 coming#t66 Sunday,#t66 March#t66 eighth#t66. A major focus of International Women's Day is the plight of Afghan women. Special events#e67 are being organized#e3 by the European Commission and individual nations in Europe, North America, and other parts of the world. Lisa Schlein reports from Geneva.

Afghanistan has been at war for twenty#t70 years#t70, leaving#e6 a large part of the country's male population dead or in exile. The United Nations says#e7 women and children make#e8 up about seventy-five percent of the Afghan population. An Afghan refugee in Switzerland, Homira Atimadi, is a senior official of a group called the International Working Group on Afghan Women. The group has branches in Pakistan, Iran, Europe, Australia, and North America. Ms. Atimadi says#e10 Afghan women have been victims of severe violations#e75 of human rights for the#t77 past#t77 twenty#t77 years#t77 and she says#e12 she sees#e13 no end#e78 to the misery. She says#e15 security under the fundamentalist Taleban government is better#e80, but everything else is worse#e81.

Women do not become#e18 victims of armed attack#e20, but they do not have the right to work#e21. And today#t87, the right to work is equal#e90 to r- the right to survival.

Ms. Atimadi says#e23 the war#e24 has created#e25 a nation of widows. Women have become#e26 the sole support#e27 of their families. Yet, the Taliban have forbidden#e28 them to work#e29. She says#e30 this puts#e31 the very existence of women's families at risk. She says#e34 the plight of women in urban areas is greater#e94 than that which exists in rural parts of the country. In cities, such as the capital Kabul, women are totally dependent#e95 on international aid for survival. Ms. Atimadi says#e40 the women of Kabul symbolize#e351 the suffering of all the women in Afghanistan.

The aim is to bring#e97 in not only the focus on women's right to education, access to work, but look#e45 beyond that and look#e46 at the roots of, uh of these problems. These are only the symptoms of the problems that are facing#e48 Afghanistan. For women in Afghanistan to be able#e352 to realize#e51 their rights, there have to be conditions of peace and justice.

Ms. Atimadi says#e55 that is the primary focus of her group, peace and justice. She says#e57 her group is appealing#e104 to individuals, to the international community, and to the combatants and people of Afghanistan to stop#e60 the bloodletting#e105 which has torn#e61 the country apart.
