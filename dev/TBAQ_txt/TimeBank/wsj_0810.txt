Cie. de Navigation Mixte Chairman Marc Fournier said#e1 his board unanimously rejected#e2 as too low the $1.77 billion bid#e3 by Cie. Financiere de Paribas to bring#e5 its stake in Navigation Mixte to 66.7%.

At a news conference#e148, Mr. Fournier accused#e7 Paribas of planning#e8 to pay#e10 for the takeover#e11 by selling parts of the company, whose interests include insurance, banking, tuna canning, sugar and orange juice.

The chairman said#e16 his board members, including representatives of West German insurance giant Allianz AG and French banks Credit Lyonnais and Societe Generale, hold#e17 nearly 50% of Navigation Mixte's capital.

Mr. Fournier said#e18 that as Navigation Mixte chairman, he is prohibited#e19 by takeover regulations from organizing#e22 his own defense or doing#e24 anything besides managing#e25 current company business. But sources said#e27 he will be urging#e28 his allies to boost#e30 their stakes in Navigation Mixte, which is being traded#e31 in London and is to resume#e33 trading#e34 in Paris Tuesday#t153. At the same time, he is expected#e36 to seek#e38 legal and regulatory means of blocking#e40 or delaying#e41 Paribas's bid#e42. For the moment, the sources said#e43, he has decided#e44 against seeking#e45 a white knight or organizing#e46 a counterbid#e156 for Paribas.

Mr. Fournier said#e47 Navigation Mixte's 1989#t157 unconsolidated, or parent-company, profit is likely to be 4.7 billion francs ($754.4 million), up from 633.8 million francs last#t162 year#t162. That is due mostly to payments#e49 from Allianz for most of the 50% stake it has agreed#e51 to acquire#e53 in Navigation Mixte's insurance business. Mr. Fournier said#e55 the exceptional gain would mean#e2258 nearly twice as high a dividend this#t163 year#t163 as last#t167. If holders avoid#e59 tendering#e60 to Paribas, he added#e61, they can expect#e62 strong dividends again next#t169 year#t169.

Analysts noted#e64 that over the#t173 past#t173 20#t173 years#t173, Mr. Fournier has built#e65 his company through astute stock-market activity and has warded#e68 off at least three takeover attempts#e69. This time, however, some analysts think#e71 he could face#e177 a real battle#e72.

"Without some unexpected "coup de theatre", I don't see#e74 what will block#e76 the Paribas bid#e178," said#e77 Philippe de Cholet, analyst at the brokerage Cholet-Dupont amp Cie. Mr. de Cholet said#e79 Mr. Fournier's biggest hope was to somehow persuade#e81 regulatory authorities to block#e83 the bid#e84. Paribas still needs the go-ahead from the Commission des Operations de Bourse, a government regulatory agency, but analysts said#e87 that is considered likely.

Mr. Fournier also noted#e89 that Navigation Mixte joined#e90 Paribas's core of shareholders when Paribas was denationalized#e92 in 1987#t1994, and said#e93 it now#t1995 holds#e94 just under 5% of Paribas's shares. Once he realized#e95 that Paribas's intentions weren't friendly, he said#e96, but before the bid#e97 was launched#e99, he sought#e100 approval#e101 to boost#e103 his Paribas stake above 10%. The petition is still pending#e105, but Mr. Fournier downplayed#e106 the likelihood of his organizing#e107 a takeover bid#e108 of his own for the much-larger Paribas.

One big question now is the likely role of Mr. Fournier's allies. Mr. Fournier said#e111 the large institutions that hold nearly 50% of Navigation Mixte's capital all strongly support#e113 him, but some analysts said#e114 they aren't so sure. Allianz, for example, has said#e115 in official comments so far that it will remain#e118 neutral. Paribas is Allianz's lead French bank.

Paribas said#e120 Monday#t2003 that it intends#e121 to bid#e122 to boost#e124 its stake in Navigation Mixte to 66.7%, from the 18.7% it already owns#e126. The purchase#e127 of the additional 48% stake is expected#e129 to cost#e2010 more than 11 billion francs ($1.77 billion).

Paribas says#e130 it will offer#e131 1,850 francs ($296.95) each for Navigation Mixte shares that enjoy#e132 full dividend rights, and 1,800 francs each for a block of shares issued July#t2011 1#t2011, which will receive#e134 only partial dividends this#t2012 year#t2012. Alternatively, it is to offer#e135 three Paribas shares for one Navigation Mixte share. The Paribas offer values Navigation Mixte at about 23 billion francs, depending on how many of Navigation Mixte's warrants are converted into shares during the takeover battle.
