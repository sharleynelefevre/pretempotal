Crossland Savings Stock Plunges as Firm @ Recommends Suspension of Dividends @ ---- @ By Udayan Gupta @ Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal 10/30/89 WALL STREET JOURNAL (J) CRL DIVIDENDS (DIV) FINANCIAL, ACCOUNTING, LEASING (FIN) EARNINGS (ERN) NEW YORK


Crossland Savings Bank's stock plummeted#e1 after management recommended#e4 a suspension#e82 of dividend payments on both its common and preferred stock because Crossland may not meet#e6 the new government capital criteria effective Dec.#t85 7#t85.

In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange Friday#t86, Crossland closed#e11 at $5.25, down $1.875, a 26% decline.

A spokesman said#e12 the savings bank may not qualify#e13 for the capital requirements because, under the proposed guidelines, its $380 million of preferred stock doesn't meet#e18 the "core capital" criteria outlined under the new Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989#t89. He added#e22 that final guidelines to be published#e25 in early#t191 November#t191 will determine#e26 whether the bank is in compliance.

Crossland said#e29 it retained#e30 three investment bankers to assist#e32 it in developing#e34 and implementing#e35 a financial restructuring plan. It wouldn't identify#e36 the bankers.

Additionally, Crossland reported#e39 a third-quarter#t92 loss#e40 of $175.5 million, or $13.44 a share, compared with net income of $27.1 million, or $1.16 a share, a#t95 year#t95 ago#t95. A major factor in the third-quarter#t98 loss#e43 was the write-down of $143.6 million of goodwill.

The spokesman said#e45 that the proposed guidelines caused#e47 Crossland to revise#e49 its business objectives and, consequently, to write#e50 down the asset value of some previous acquisitions. Crossland recorded#e52 an additional $20 million in loan loss reserves in the#t105 third#t105 quarter#t105.

Net interest income for the#t104 third#t104 quarter#t104 declined to $35.6 million from $70.1 million a#t111 year#t111 ago#t111. However, non-interest income rose#e55 to $23.5 million from $22 million. Third-quarter#t116 loan originations dropped#e57 sharply to $663 million from $1 billion a#t122 year#t122 ago#t122.

Standard amp Poor's Corp. lowered#e58 the rating on Crossland's preferred stock to double-C from single-B-minus and placed#e60 it on CreditWatch for possible further downgrade. It also placed#e61 on CreditWatch for possible downgrade other securities, including the double-B-minus/B rating of Crossland's certificates of deposit and the single-B rating of its senior subordinated capital notes. About $518 million of debt is affected.
