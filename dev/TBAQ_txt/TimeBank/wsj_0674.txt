Jim Pattison Industries Ltd., one of a group of closely held companies owned by entrepreneur James Pattison, said#e2 it "intends#e3 to seek#e5 control" of 30%-owned Innopac Inc., a Toronto packaging concern.

Jim Pattison Industries, a holding company with annual sales of about C$1.9 billion, largely from car dealerships and grocery stores, didn't elaborate#e7 on the statement, and a company official declined#e11 further comment#e12.

The company said#e13 it currently#t42 holds#e14 about 4.2 million of Innopac's 13.8 million common shares outstanding, which have#e43 an aggregate market value of about 137.8 million Canadian dollars (US$117.3 million).

Separately, Innopac reported#e15 a fourth-quarter#t44 loss#e16 of about C$2.6 million, or 18 Canadian cents a share, reflecting inventory write-downs#e45. The results#e18 made#e19 net income for the#t49 year#t49 ended Aug.#t50 31#t50 C$2.7 million, or 20 Canadian cents a share, down from C$9.7 million, or 70 Canadian cents a share last#t52 year#t52. Revenue#e56 was C$291.6 million, up from C$252 million in 1988#t58.

Martin Fabi, Innopac's president and chief executive, said#e21 Innopac viewed#e22 Mr. Pattison's decision#e23 to seek#e25 control as a "very positive" move#e26. "I'm happy#e63 that he feels#e64 positively about our company," he said#e28. Mr. Fabi wouldn't say#e29 directly whether Mr. Pattison has disclosed#e30 potential terms for his planned bid#e31 for control.

Among other things, Innopac is involved in recycling polystyrene foam products that are often used by fast food chains, such as McDonald's Corp., for food packaging. A joint venture involving units of Innopac and Mobil Corp. earlier#t69 this#t69 year#t69 opened#e37 the first U.S. polystyrene recycling plant, in Leominster, Mass.
