International: @ Courtaulds PLC @ Plans to Spin Off @ Textiles Business @ ---- @ By Craig Forman @ Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal 10/31/89 WALL STREET JOURNAL (J) COU DIVIDENDS (DIV) STOCK MARKET, OFFERINGS (STK) TEXTILES AND APPAREL (TEX) LONDON


Courtaulds PLC announced#e1 plans#e85 to spin#e3 off its textiles operations to existing shareholders in a restructuring#e86 to boost#e8 shareholder value.

The British chemical and textile company's plan, which requires shareholder approval, would create#e11 a new, listed U.K. stock with a probable market capitalization between #300 million ($473 million) and #400 million, analysts said#e15. The establishment#e16 of the separate company, to be called Courtaulds Textiles, could be effective as early as next#t90 year's#t90 first#t90 quarter#t90.

Investors welcomed#e20 the move#e21. Courtaulds' shares rose#e22 15 pence to 362 pence, valuing the entire company at about #1.44 billion.

Courtaulds' spinoff#e93 reflects pressure on British industry to boost share prices beyond the reach of corporate raiders. Courtaulds' restructuring#e94 is among the largest thus far in Britain, though it is dwarfed by B.A.T Industries PLC's plans#e95 to spin#e31 roughly off #4 billion in assets to help#e33 fend#e34 off a takeover bid from Anglo-French financier Sir James Goldsmith. The divested Courtaulds textile operations had#e96 operating profit#e97 of #50 million on #980 million in revenue in the#t99 year#t99 ended March#t100 31#t100.

Some analysts have said#e37 Courtaulds' moves#e38 could boost#e39 the company's value by 5% to 10%, because the two entities separately will carry#e41 a higher price earnings multiple than they did combined#e103. In addition, Courtaulds said#e45 the moves#e46 are logical because they will allow#e47 both the chemicals and textile businesses to focus#e104 more closely on core activities.

Courtaulds has been under#e119 pressure to enhance#e54 shareholder value since takeover speculators -- including Australian financier Kerry Packer -- surfaced#e55 holding small stakes last#t108 year#t108. Though Mr. Packer has since sold#e58 his stake, Courtaulds is moving#e60 to keep#e62 its institutional shareholders happy. Even without a specific takeover threat, Courtaulds is giving#e64 shareholders "choice and value," said#e66 Julia Blake, an analyst at London stockbrokers Barclays de Zoete Wedd.

In a statement, the company said: "Both parts can only realize their full potential and be appropriately valued by the market if they are separately quoted companies. The sharper definition and the autonomy which each will thereby gain will benefit shareholders, customers and employees."

Courtaulds Chairman and Chief Executive Sir Christopher Hogg will remain#e77 in both posts at the surviving chemical company after the spinoff.
