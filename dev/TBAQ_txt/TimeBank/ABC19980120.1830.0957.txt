ABC19980120.1830.0957 NEWS STORY


For his part, Fidel Castro is the ultimate political survivor. People have predicted#e1 his demise#e86 so many times, and the US has tried#e2 to hasten#e4 it on several occasions. Time and again, he endures#e87. He has outlasted#e7 and sometimes outsmarted#e8 eight American presidents. Fidel Castro invited#e9 John Paul to come#e11 for a reason. This is clearly an opportunity for Cuba to look good internationally.

The entire world will see#e15 images of the Pope in Cuba. They'll see#e16 images of the Pope with Fidel Castro. It will give#e18 the rest of the world the view that Cuba is like any other nation, something the US has, of course, tried#e22 to persuade#e24 the world that it is not.

For nearly#t94 forty#t94 years#t94, the United States has said#e26 categorically it would not tolerate#e99 totalitarian rule in its own backyard. It is the US economic and political embargo#e240 which has kept#e30 Cuba in a box.

The main positive for Castro to invite#e32 the Pope is international, to be able#e100 to say#e35 to the rest of the world, this government is not as closed, as intolerant, uh as totalitarian as some make#e38 it out to be.

One of the scenarios widely advanced#e103 before the visit#e42 is that through the Pope, Cuba, still led#e44 by Castro, can begin#e45 a more productive relationship with the world. That will, in turn, bring#e48 pressure on Washington to change#e50.

Those observers looking#e51 for a battle#e52 between uncompromising representatives and very different ideologies will, in all likelihood, be disappointed#e53.

Castro has said that you can be a Communist and still be a Christian. He says#e56 he and the Pope both want#e57 to end#e59 the exploitation#e60 of man by man. The question is who will Cubans believe#e378?

The main negative is the risk that the Pope's visit#e63 will persuade#e64 a great many more Cubans to break#e66 loose of the Cuban government. If so, then the Pope's visit#e67 would really open#e112 up a new chapter in the government's relations with its own society. For the Cuban government, that is the risk.

At the end of the broadcast this#t1000 evening#t1000, one more trip around Havana to see what it's been like since the last time. And in just a moment Diane Sawyer will have some other news.
