Aetna Life amp Casualty @ Profit Decreased 22% @ In the Third Quarter 10/30/89 WALL STREET JOURNAL (J) AET EARNINGS (ERN) INSURANCE (INS) HARTFORD, Conn.


Aetna Life amp Casualty Co.'s third-quarter#t44 net income fell#e1 22% to $182.6 million, or $1.63 a share, reflecting the damages#e47 from Hurricane Hugo and lower results#e3 for some of the company's major divisions.

Catastrophe losses#e48 reduced#e4 Aetna's net income by $50 million, including $36 million from Hugo. Last#t49 year#t49 catastrophe losses#e50 totaled $5 million, when net#e7 was $235.5 million, or $2.07 a share. The year-earlier#t52 results#e8 have been restated#e9 to reflect#e11 an accounting change#e12.

The insurer has started#e13 processing#e54 claims#e14 from the Northern California earthquake#e55 nearly#t57 two#t57 weeks#t57 ago#t57. But because these claims are more difficult to evaluate and have been coming#e18 in more slowly, the company has#e19 no estimate#e20 of the impact#e21 of the earthquake#e60 on fourth-quarter#t61 results#e22.

In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday#t63, Aetna closed#e24 at $60, down 50 cents.

In the#t65 latest#t65 quarter#t65, Aetna had#e67 a $23 million loss#e25 on its auto/homeowners line, compared with earnings#e68 of $33 million last#t69 year#t69. Profit for its commercial insurance division fell#e28 30% to $59 million, reflecting higher catastrophe losses#e70 and the price war#e71 in the property/casualty market for nearly#t73 three#t73 years#t73.

However, Aetna's employee benefits division, which includes its group health insurance operations, posted#e34 a 34% profit gain#e74 to $106 million.

Third-quarter#t75 results#e35 included net realized capital gains#e76 of $48 million, which included#e89 $27 million from the sale#e39 of Federated Investors in August#t80 and a $15 million tax credit.

In the#t81 nine#t81 months#t81, net rose#e42 4.3% to $525.8 million or $4.67 a share, from $504.2 million, or $4.41 a share, last#t85 year#t85.
