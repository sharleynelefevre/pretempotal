Letters to the Editor: @ Innovators Overlooked 11/01/89 WALL STREET JOURNAL (J) MUTUAL AND MONEY-MARKET FUNDS (FND)


I was pleased#e41 to note#e2 that your Oct.#t42 23#t42 Centennial Journal item recognized#e3 the money-fund concept as one of the significant events of the past century. Actually, about#t39 two#t39 years#t39 ago#t39, the Journal listed#e4 the creation#e5 of the money fund as one of the 10 most significant events in the world of finance in the#t40 20th#t40 century#t40. But the Reserve Fund, America's first money fund, was not named#e9, nor were the creators of the money-fund concept, Harry Brown and myself. We innovated#e11 telephone redemptions#e29, daily dividends, total elimination#e30 of share certificates and the constant $1 pershare pricing, all of which were painfully thought#e15 out and not the result of some inadvertence#e32 on the part of the SEC.
