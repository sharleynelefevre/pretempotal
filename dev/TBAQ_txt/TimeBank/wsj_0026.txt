Duty-Free Status Cleared @ For Certain Watch Imports 11/02/89 WALL STREET JOURNAL (J) MONETARY NEWS, FOREIGN EXCHANGE, TRADE (MON) EXECUTIVE (EXE) WASHINGTON


The White House said#e1 President Bush has approved#e2 duty-free treatment#e25 for imports of certain types of watches that aren't produced#e3 in "significant quantities" in the U.S., the Virgin Islands and other U.S. possessions.

The action#e26 came#e5 in response to a petition filed#e6 by Timex Inc. for changes in the U.S. Generalized System of Preferences for imports from developing nations. Previously, watch imports were denied#e10 such duty-free treatment#e29.

Timex had requested#e11 duty-free treatment for many types of watches, covered by 58 different U.S. tariff classifications. The White House said#e13 Mr. Bush decided#e14 to grant#e15 duty-free status for 18 categories, but turned#e16 down such treatment#e31 for other types of watches "because of the potential for material injury to watch producers located in the U.S. and the Virgin Islands."

Timex is a major U.S. producer#e32 and seller#e33 of watches, including low-priced battery-operated watches assembled in the Philippines and other developing nations covered by the U.S. tariff preferences.

U.S. trade officials said#e22 the Philippines and Thailand would be the main beneficiaries#e123 of the president's action#e34.

Imports of the types of watches that now#t38 will be eligible#e39 for duty-free treatment totaled#e23 about $37.3 million in 1988#t37, a relatively small share of the $1.5 billion in U.S. watch imports that#t1000 year#t1000, according#e40 to an aide to U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills.
