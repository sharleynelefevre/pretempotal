In Washington today#t53, the Federal Aviation Administration released#e1 air traffic control tapes from the night the TWA Flight eight hundred went#e2 down. There's nothing new on why the plane exploded#e3, but you cannot miss the moment. ABC's Lisa Stark has more.

There was no hint of trouble in the last conversation#e10 between controllers and TWA pilot Steven Snyder TWA eight hundred climb maintain#e13 one five thousand.

TWA's eight hundred heavy climb and maintain#e15 one five thousand leavin- three thousand.

But a#t58 minute#t58 and#t58 a#t58 half#t58 later, a pilot from a nearby flight calls#e18 in.

Ah, we just saw#e19 an explosion#e20 up ahead of us here about sixteen thousand feet or something like that. It just went#e21 down.

The controller at Boston center tries#e22 to raise#e24 TWA eight hundred.

TWA eight hundred, if you hear#e26 center, ident#e60.

There is no response#e61. Later, the controller asks#e28 the Eastwind pilot for more details.

Ah yes, sir. It- It just blew#e30 up in the air, and then we saw#e33 two fireballs go#e34 down to the, to the water, and there was a big small, ah, smoke, from ah, coming#e36 up from that.

At one point, when it became#e38 clear controllers could not contact#e235 the plane, someone said#e43 a prayer.

God bless him.
