Kellogg Pours Water on Plans to Build Big Cereal Plant @ ---- @ By Richard Gibson @ Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal 10/30/89 WALL STREET JOURNAL (J) K FOOD PRODUCTS (FOD)


This hasn't been Kellogg Co.'s year. The oat-bran craze#e190 has cost#e189 the world's largest cereal maker market share. The company's president quit#e3 suddenly. And now#t296 Kellogg is indefinitely suspending#e4 work#e5 on what was to be a $1 billion cereal plant.

The company said#e7 it was delaying#e8 construction#e9 because of current#t193 market conditions#e191. But the Memphis, Tenn., facility wasn't to begin#e10 turning#e11 out product until 1993#t196, so the decision#e12 may reveal a more pessimistic long-term outlook as well.

Kellogg, which hasn't been as successful#e198 in capitalizing#e17 on the public's health-oriented desire for oat bran as rival General Mills Inc., has been losing#e18 share in the $6 billion ready-to-eat cereal market. Kellogg's current#t200 share is believed#e19 to be slightly under 40% while General Mills' share is about 27%.

Led#e22 by its oat-based Cheerios line, General Mills has gained#e24 an estimated 2% share so far this#t419 year#t419, mostly at the expense of Kellogg. Each share point is worth about $60 million in sales.

Analysts say#e28 much of Kellogg's erosion#e204 has been in such core brands as Corn Flakes, Rice Krispies and Frosted Flakes, which represent nearly one-third of its sales volume. Kellogg is so anxious#e206 to turn#e32 around Corn Flakes sales that it soon#t207 will begin#e33 selling#e34 boxes for as little as 99 cents, trade sources say#e35.

"Cheerios and Honey Nut Cheerios have eaten#e36 away sales normally going#e38 to Kellogg's corn-based lines simply because they are made#e40 of oats," says#e41 Merrill Lynch food analyst William Maguire. "They are not a happy#e1051 group of people at Battle Creek right#t209 now#t209." Kellogg is based in Battle Creek, Mich., a city that calls itself the breakfast capital of the world.

Another analyst, John C. Maxwell Jr. of Wheat, First Securities in Richmond, Va., recently#t210 went#e1061 to a "sell" recommendation on Kellogg stock, which closed#e48 Friday#t211 at $71.75, down 75 cents, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. "I don't think#e49 Kellogg can get#e51 back to 40% this#t214 year#t214," he said#e53. "Kellogg's main problem is life style. People are reading#e215 the boxes and deciding#e55 they want#e56 something that's `healthy' for you -- oats, bran." Mr. Maxwell said#e57 he wouldn't be surprised#e58 if, over the#t220 next#t220 two#t220 years#t220 or#t220 so#t220, General Mills' share increased#e62 to 30% or more.

In announcing#e63 the plant delay#e64, Kellogg Chairman William E. LaMothe said#e65, "Cereal volume growth#e224 in the U.S. has not met#e66 our expectations#e223 for 1989#t226". He said#e68 construction#e69 wouldn't resume#e70 until market conditions warrant#e73 it.

Kellogg indicated#e74 that it has#e75 room to grow#e77 without adding#e229 facilities. The company has#e78 five other U.S. plants, including a modern facility at its Battle Creek headquarters known as Building 100, which is to add#e81 bran-processing and rice-processing capacity next#t230 year#t230.

General Mills, meanwhile, finds itself constrained#e83 from boosting#e85 sales further because its plants are operating#e86 at capacity. A large plant in Covington, Ga., is to come#e88 on line next#t233 year#t233.

A Kellogg officer, who asked not to be named, said#e91 the Memphis project was " pulled#e235 in for a reconsideration#e93 of costs," an indication that the ambitious plans might be scaled#e95 back in any future construction#e97. Initial cost estimates for the plant, which was to have been built in phases, ranged#e103 from $1 billion to $1.2 billion.

A company spokesman said#e104 it was "possible, but highly unlikely," that the plant might never be built#e105. "As we regain#e107 our leadership level where we have been, and as we continue#e108 to put#e110 new products into the marketplace and need#e113 additional capacity, we will look#e114 at resuming#e116 our involvement#e117 with our plan," he said#e118.

The new facility was to have been the world's most advanced cereal manufacturing plant, and Kellogg's largest construction project. The company had retained#e121 the Fluor Daniel unit of Fluor Corp. as general contractor.

But in recent#t248 weeks#t248, construction-industry sources reported#e122 that early preparation work was slowing#e124 at the 185-acre site. Subcontractors said#e125 they were told#e126 that equipment orders#e249 would be delayed#e128. Fluor Daniel already has reassigned#e130 most of its work crew, the sources said#e131.

Last#t251 Friday#t251's announcement#e132 was the first official word that the project was in#e1053 trouble and that the company's plans for a surge in market share may have been overly optimistic#e1054. Until recently#t257, Kellogg had been telling#e140 its sales force and Wall Street that by 1992#t258 it intended#e141 to achieve#e143 a 50% share of market, measured in dollar volume.

Although he called#e261 current market conditions "highly competitive," Mr. LaMothe, Kellogg's chairman and chief executive officer, forecast#e146 an earnings increase#e147 for the#t264 full#t264 year#t264. Last#t265 year#t265, the company earned#e148 $480.4 million, or $3.90 a share, on sales of $4.3 billion.

As expected#e266, Kellogg reported#e150 lower third-quarter#t268 earnings. Net fell#e151 16% to $123.1 million, or $1.02 a share, from $145.7 million, or $1.18 a share. Sales rose#e153 4.8% to $1.20 billion from $1.14 billion.

The company had#e154 a one-time charge#e278 of $14.8 million in the#t279 latest#t279 quarter#t279 covering the disposition#e156 of certain assets. The company wouldn't elaborate#e157, citing#e160 competitive reasons.
