Kimberly-Clark Corp. @ Net Income Rose 20% @ In the Third Quarter 11/01/89 WALL STREET JOURNAL (J) KMB EARNINGS (ERN) PULP, PAPER, PACKAGING (ALL TYPES) (PUL) DALLAS


Despite continuing problems in its newsprint business, Kimberly-Clark Corp. posted#e4 a 20% gain#e38 in third-quarter#t82 net income#e37.

The consumer-products and newsprint company said#e5 net rose#e6 to $108.8 million, or $1.35 a share, from $90.5 million, or $1.12 a share, a#t78 year#t78 ago#t78. Sales rose#e8 6.2% to $1.45 billion from $1.37 billion.

After a#t79 flat#t79 second#t79 quarter#t79 tied#e9 largely to lower newsprint earnings, Kimberly-Clark attributed#e10 the gain#e51 to improved results#e11 in its consumer businesses in North America, Brazil and Korea. Those gains#e55 came from higher prices, particularly for disposable diapers and tissue products, and from increased sales#e54, primarily for feminine-care products, the company said#e17. Newsprint results continued#e19 to be depressed#e57, the company added#e56, because of industrywide price discounting#e22.

The quarter-to-quarter comparison was also enhanced#e24 by charges#e25 taken#e26 in the#t85 year-earlier#t85 period#t85, including $11 million related to the modernization#e28 of a pulp and newsprint mill in Alabama. In the#t86 1989#t86 period#t86 also, interest expense and tax rates were lower#e62 than a#t87 year#t87 ago#t87.

In the#t88 first#t88 nine#t88 months#t88, profit rose#e30 10% to $313.2 million, or $3.89 a share, from $283.9 million, or $3.53 a share. Sales rose#e32 6.7% to $4.27 billion from $4 billion.

In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Kimberly-Clark closed#e33 at $66.50 a share, up $1.50.
