Du Pont Posts @ 19% Profit Rise @ For 3rd Quarter @ ---- @ By Richard Koenig @ Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal 10/26/89 WALL STREET JOURNAL (J) DD VO EARNINGS (ERN) CHEMICALS, PLASTICS (CHM) DIVIDENDS (DIV)


Du Pont Co. reported#e1 that third-quarter#t139 profit grew#e2 a robust 19% from a#t128 year#t128 ago#t128 on the strength of the company's operations#e3 in various chemicals and fibers, and in petroleum.

Du Pont also raised#e5 its quarterly dividend to $1.20 a share from $1.05, a change#e6 that will increase#e7 the annualized payout to shareholders by some $140 million.

Du Pont, unlike companies hurt#e8 badly by sharp price declines#e133 for basic chemicals and plastics, is benefiting#e9 from its broad range of businesses. The profit gain was made#e12 despite a weakening#e13 in the housing market, for which the company is a supplier, and a strengthening#e16 in the dollar, which lowers#e19 the value of overseas earnings when they are translated into dollars.

The Wilmington, Del., company reported#e24 net of $547 million, or $2.36 a share, which was in line with Wall Street estimates#e136. In the#t140 year-earlier#t140 period#t140, the company earned#e27 $461 million, or $1.91 a share. Sales in the#t141 latest#t141 quarter#t141 were $8.59 billion, up 9.4% from $7.85 billion.

The dividend increase#e29 was Du Pont's second this#t148 year#t148, an affirmation#e30 of statements by top executives that they intend#e32 to increase#e34 rewards to shareholders. "We haven't benefited#e36 the shareholder as much as we need#e38 to," said#e39 Edgar Woolard Jr., Du Pont's chairman and chief executive officer, in an interview#e40 several#t151 months#t151 before he entered#e42 his current#t152 position in April#t153.

The largest beneficiary will be Seagram Co., which owns about 23% of Du Pont. A spokesman for Seagram, the Montreal wine and spirits concern controlled by the Bronfman family, said#e45 the company will post#e46 additional pretax profit#e725 of about $33 million a#t157 year#t157 because of the additional Du Pont dividends.

Du Pont also announced#e47 plans#e158 for a 3-for-1 stock split#e48, although the initial higher dividend will be paid#e49 on pre-split shares. Du Pont's stock rose#e51 $2.50 a share to close#e53 at $117.375 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday#t160. Seagram closed#e54 at $84.75, up 12.5 cents a share in Big Board trading.

Leading#e55 the gains for Du Pont in the#t163 latest#t163 quarter#t163 was its industrial products segment, where profit soared#e57 to $155 million from $99 million a#t164 year#t164 earlier#t164. The company benefited#e58 from continued strong demand#e59 and higher selling prices for titanium dioxide, a white pigment used in paints, paper and plastics.

James Fallon, a New Providence, N.J., marketing consultant to the chemicals industry, says#e65 Du Pont still holds#e66 an edge in making the pigment because the company was "first in with the technology" to lower costs. He said#e70 Du Pont holds#e71 about 23% of the world-wide market, the largest single share, at a time when growing uses for the pigment have kept it in tight supply, although others are now adding low-cost production capacity.

Profit climbed#e81 to $98 million from $71 million in the petroleum segment, as Du Pont's Conoco Inc. oil company was helped#e83 by crude oil prices higher than a#t181 year#t181 ago#t181 and by higher natural gas prices and volume.

In the diversifed businesses segment, which includes herbicides, profit grew#e88 to $64 million from $27 million. A spokesman said#e89 herbicide use#e188 in some areas of the U.S. was delayed#e187 earlier#t190 in#t190 the#t190 year#t190 by heavy rains#e191, thus increasing#e93 sales in the#t193 third#t193 quarter#t193.

In the fibers segment, profit rose#e95 to $180 million from $155 million, a gain Du Pont attributed#e96 to higher demand#e97 in the U.S. for most textile products.

Two segments posted#e98 lower earnings#e198 for the#t200 quarter#t200. Profit from coal fell#e100 to $41 million from $58 million, partly because of a miners' strike#e101. And profit from polymers dropped#e102 to $107 million from $122 million amid what Du Pont called lower demand and selling prices in certain packaging and industrial markets.

For the#t729 nine#t729 months#t729, Du Pont earned#e108 $2 billion, or $8.46 a share, up 18% from $1.69 billion, or $7.03 a share, a#t219 year#t219 earlier#t219. Sales increased#e110 10% to $26.54 billion from $24.05 billion.

The increased dividend will be paid#e111 Dec.#t220 14#t220 to holders of record Nov.#t221 15#t221. The stock split#e113, which is subject to holder approval#e116, would be paid#e117 on a still unspecified date in January#t225 to holders of record Dec.#t229 21#t229.
