Reupke Quits Post @ As General Manager @ Of Reuters Holdings 11/02/89 WALL STREET JOURNAL (J) RTRSY WNEWS LONDON


Reuters Holdings PLC said#e1 Michael Reupke resigned#e2 as general manager to pursue unspecified interests, a move#e97 the news organization termed an "amicable separation."

Mr. Reupke, 52 years old and a 27-year#t42 Reuters veteran, had been the information-services company's general manager#e360 for only six#t43 months#t43. His appointment#e51 to that post, which has senior administrative, staff and policy responsibilities, followed#e6 a several-year#t44 tenure#e52 as Reuters's editor in chief. No successor was named#e7, and Mr. Reupke's duties will be split#e8 among three other senior Reuters executives, the company said#e9.

In a telephone interview, Mr. Reupke said#e10 his departure#e55 was for "personal reasons," which he declined to specify. "There is no business reason for my departure#e57," nor any disagreement over policy, he added#e14. He also rejected#e15 reports that his departure#e59 stemmed#e16 from disappointment the general manager's post hadn't also led#e69 to a board directorship at the London-based news organization.

Mr. Reupke was one of three executives on Reuters's eight-person executive committee who didn't also serve#e21 on the company's board of directors. "If I were choosing#e23 the people of tomorrow, I would have chosen#e24 the people who are now#t46 on#e363 the board," he said#e27.

A Reuters spokesman said#e28 the departure#e65 reflects#e29 "no change#e72 in strategy or profits." Mark Shepperd, an analyst at UBS Phillips amp Drew in London, said#e30, "I suspect#e31 (the departure#e66) will be fairly irrelevant#e67 for the company. I would be very surprised#e32 if his departure#e75 signals#e76 any change#e77 in strategy or change#e79 in profit expectations." On London's Stock Exchange, Reuters shares rose#e35 five pence to 913 pence ($14.43). In the U.S. over-the-counter market, American depositary shares for Reuters, each representing three shares in the London market, closed#e36 unchanged at $43.875.

The senior of the three executives who will assume#e37 Mr. Reupke's duties#e358 is Nigel Judah, 58, finance director and a Reuters board director. Peter Holland, 45, deputy general manager, becomes#e38 director of corporate affairs. And Patrick Mannix, 46, international technical manager, becomes#e39 director of group quality programs.
