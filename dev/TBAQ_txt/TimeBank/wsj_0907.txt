Chandler Insurance Earnings 10/26/89 WALL STREET JOURNAL (J) CHANF GRAND CAYMAN, Cayman Islands


Chandler Insurance Co. said#e1 it expects#e2 to report#e4 third-quarter#t22 net income jumped#e5 97% to $2.8 million, or 51 cents a share.

In the#t60 year-earlier#t60 quarter#t60, the automobile and trucking insurer had#e6 earnings#e25 of $1.4 million, or 48 cents a share on a restated basis, on revenue of $16.5 million. In an interview#e7, W. Brent LeGere, chairman and chief executive officer, said#e8 he expects#e9 revenue in the#t26 latest#t26 quarter#t26 to total#e11 about $28 million. The earnings-per-share figures reflect a 25% stock dividend in June#t31 1989#t31.

Mr. LeGere attributed#e14 the earnings increase#e15 to growth#e17 in the company's longhaul trucking insurance lines and the ability to keep#e20 premium rates firm.
