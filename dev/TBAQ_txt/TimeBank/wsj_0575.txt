Control Data Says It May Repurchase @ Debt Soon, Seeks Alliances With Others @ ---- @ By Richard Gibson @ Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal 10/30/89 WALL STREET JOURNAL (J) CDA COMPUTERS AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (CPR) TENDER OFFERS, MERGERS, ACQUISITIONS (TNM) MINNEAPOLIS


Control Data Corp., which just months#t204 ago#t204 was hemorrhaging#e1 financially, thinks#e2 it will be healthy#e2438 enough soon#t206 to consider#e3 repurchasing#e4 public debt.

Moreover, the company, whose go-it-alone approach nearly proved#e6 fatal, now#t2041 sees#e7 alliances with others as the way back to prosperity in what it calls "the data solutions" business.

"I'm not saying everything is hunky-dory, but we have completed#e15 the transition#e16," Robert M. Price, chairman and chief executive, said#e17 in an interview#e18. "Transition" is a reference to the company's five-year#t209 restructuring effort#e22. During that#t213 time#t213, Control Data had#e24 losses of more than $1 billion.

Now, following asset sales that shrank#e26 revenue by more than one-third this#t2110 year#t2110 alone, Control Data is flush#e215 with cash. So its senior executives are talking#e28 openly about possibly buying#e29 back some of the company's $172.5 million in subordinated convertible debentures next#t218 year#t218.

"We'd like#e221 to continue#e33 to reduce#e35 debt," President Lawrence Perlman said#e36. Noting#e37 that the company is offering#e38 to buy#e40 back $154.2 million in senior notes paying#e43 12 3/4%, he said#e44 the response will help#e45 determine#e46 future debt-reduction efforts#e47. The offer#e48 was automatically triggered#e49 by the recent#t222 sale#e50 of Control Data's Imprimis disk-drive business to Seagate Technology Inc.

Mr. Perlman, who is also acting chief financial officer and the odds-on favorite to become the next chief executive, said#e55 the company is achieving#e56 "modest positive cash flow#e57 from operations, and we expect#e60 that to continue#e62 into 1990#t224."

He said#e63 the company has#e64 no intention of tapping#e66 its short-term bank lines "for a#t228 good#t228 part#t228 of#t228 1990#t228." Sometime next#t229 year#t229, Control Data will " develop#e68 a new bank relationship," Mr. Perlman said#e69. In recent#t232 months#t232 a group of lenders, led by Bank of America, has extended#e71 Control Data up to $90 million in revolving loans through January#t237, as well as $115 million in standby letters of credit.

Loan covenants require that the company achieve specified levels of operating earnings and meet a rolling four-quarter profitability test. Last#t238 week#t238 Control Data reported#e80 third-quarter#t239 earnings#e240 of $9.8 million, or 23 cents a share, on revenue of $763 million. Through the#t241 first#t241 nine#t241 months#t241, the company had#e242 a loss#e81 of $484 million, largely reflecting the closing#e83 of its supercomputer unit.

While a few assets are still being shopped -- including the sports and entertainment ticketing portion of the company's Ticketron unit -- Mr. Price said#e2338 future restructuring would be a question of strategy. "We don't need#e91 the cash."

Ticketron's automated wagering business, which operates lotteries in a half dozen states, is not for sale, the company said#e100. Rather, Mr. Perlman said#e101, Control Data intends#e102 to bid#e104 for the coming Minnesota lottery contract and is seeking#e105 new applications for the technology overseas, where "there is great interest in games of skill." He wouldn't elaborate#e110.

Control Data's semiconductor business, VTC Inc., continues#e114 to lose#e116 money, the executives acknowledged#e118, but they said#e119 they consider some of the technology vital to national defense and so are reluctant#e247 to dispose#e124 of it.

The company's strategy for keeping its computer products business profitable -- it recently#t1991 achieved#e127 profitability after several#t1994 quarters#t1994 of losses#e2430 -- calls for a narrow focus and a lid on expenses. Partly, costs will be held#e132 down through strategic technology alliances, management said#e2437. Control Data recently#t1995 announced#e135 an agreement#e136 with MIPS Computer Systems Inc. to jointly develop#e138 machines with simplified operating software.

James E. Ousley, computer products group president, said#e140 such arrangements could help#e141 slash#e1998 Control Data's computer research and development costs in half by the#t2000 end#t2000 of#t2000 1990#t2000. He disclosed#e145 that before Control Data scrapped#e147 its ETA Systems Inc. supercomputer business this#t2001 past#t2001 spring#t2001, those costs were running#e148 at nearly 35% of group revenue. At the same time four of six design projects were spiked#e150, he said#e151.

Asked#e152 how the company hopes#e153 to expand#e155 its computer hardware business, Mr. Ousley said#e157 it sees#e158 good opportunities in systems integration. "We think#e161 we're getting#e162 only 10% of the integration dollars our customers are spending#e164," he said#e165. "We're in environments that are going to spend#e168 a lot of money on that."

Control Data mainframes are designed for numerically intensive computing users, such as the scientific, engineering and academic communities. Utilities management is a major commercial niche.

Reviewing#e173 the company's scrape#e174 with disaster, Mr. Price conceded#e176 it had tried#e177 to do#e178 too much on its own. "Absolutely," he said.

But while its stock is selling#e181 at about half Control Data's estimated breakup value, neither Messrs. Perlman nor Price said#e183 he spends#e184 much time considering#e186 the possibility of a hostile takeover#e187. "We've been listed#e188 as a candidate for so long it's not worth worrying about," said#e190 Mr. Price.
