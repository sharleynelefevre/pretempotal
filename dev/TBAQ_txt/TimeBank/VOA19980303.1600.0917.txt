Nigerian security forces clashed#e1 in Lagos with anti-government demonstrators who were protesting#e2 calls for military leader Sani Abacha to run#e3 for president. Meanwhile, as VOA West Africa Correspondent Purnell Murdock reports#e2104, General Abacha's supporters began#e4 a two#t25 day#t25 rally#e2008 in the capital, Abuja, to urge#e6 him to compete#e7 in this#t26 year#t26's election.

Nigeria state radio says#e8 thousands of people began#e9 gathering#e10 in the capital Abuja early#t2221 Tuesday#t2221 for the two#t28 day#t28 rally#e2079 supporting#e2109 General Sani Abacha's candidacy#e2114. Organizers state#e2120 the two#t29 days#t29 of music, dancing, and speeches is expected#e2123 to draw#e13 some two million people. But as supporters of the military leader gathered#e14 in the north, riot police deployed#e15 in Nigeria's southern commercial capital Lagos, to break#e16 up a protest rally#e2058 called#e2176 by the political opposition. Although General Abacha had not publicly announced#e18 his candidacy#e2181, many people believe#e2183 an Abacha presidency#e2184 is a foregone conclusion. Some analysts say#e2185 the outcome#e2186 of a face#e2187 off between the police and anti Abacha political groups will be a test#e2188 of the opposition's resolve. Purnell Murdock, VOA News.
