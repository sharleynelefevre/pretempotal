Provigo Will Sell Non-Food Operations @ To Concentrate on Grocery Business @ ---- @ By G. Pierre Goad @ Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal 10/26/89 WALL STREET JOURNAL (J) T.PGI WNEWS TENDER OFFERS, MERGERS, ACQUISITIONS (TNM) MONTREAL


In a stunning shift#e1 in direction, Provigo Inc. said#e3 it will sell#e4 all its non-food operations to concentrate#e7 solely on its retail and wholesale grocery business. The non-food operations accounted#e12 for about 27% of Provigo's 7.38 billion Canadian dollars (US$6.3 billion) in sales in the#t177 latest#t177 fiscal#t177 year#t177.

In a related move#e14, Pierre Lortie, chairman and chief executive, resigned#e15. Mr. Lortie joined#e16 Provigo in 1985#t141 and spearheaded#e17 the company's drive#e18 to grow#e20 outside its traditional food business. He couldn't be reached#e22 for comment.

Bertin Nadeau, newly appointed#e26 chairman and interim chief executive of Provigo, wouldn't say#e27 if Mr. Lortie was asked#e31 to leave#e33. "Mr. Lortie felt#e34 less pertinent," Mr. Nadeau said#e35, given the decision#e37 to dump#e39 Provigo's non-food operations. "At this stage it was felt#e41 I was perhaps more pertinent as chief executive." Mr. Nadeau also is chairman and chief executive of Unigesco Inc., Provigo's controlling shareholder.

At a news conference, Mr. Nadeau said#e43 the sale#e44 of the three non-food businesses, which account for nearly half the company's C$900 million in assets, should be completed#e47 in a "matter of months." The three units are a nationwide pharmaceutical and health-products distributor, a small sporting-goods chain, and a combination catalog showroom and toy-store chain.

Investors and analysts applauded#e50 the news. Provigo was the most active industrial stock on the Montreal Exchange, where it closed#e52 at C$9.75 (US$8.32), up 75 Canadian cents.

"I think#e53 it's a pretty positive development#e146," said#e55 Ross Cowan, a financial analyst with Levesque Beaubien Geoffrion Inc., of the decision#e56 to concentrate#e58 on groceries. Mr. Lortie's departure#e59, while sudden, was seen#e61 as inevitable#e328 in light of the shift#e63 in strategy. "The non-food operations were largely Mr. Lortie's creation {and} his strategy didn't work#e66," said#e68 Steven Holt, a financial analyst with Midland Doherty Ltd.

Provigo's profit record over the#t147 past#t147 two#t147 years#t147 tarnished#e70 the company's and Mr. Lortie's reputations. For the#t148 six#t148 months#t148 ended#e71 Aug.#t149 12#t149, Provigo posted#e72 net income of C$6.5 million, or eight Canadian cents a share, compared with C$18.1 million, or 21 Canadian cents a share, a#t150 year#t150 earlier#t150. Sales were C$4.2 billion compared with C$3.7 billion. Last#t151 month#t151, Canadian Bond Rating Service downgraded#e76 Provigo's commercial paper and debentures because of its lackluster performance#e79.

Analysts are skeptical#e157 Provigo will be able to sell#e81 the non-food businesses as a group for at least book value, and are expecting#e84 write-downs#e158. Mr. Nadeau said#e85 he couldn't yet say#e86 if the sale prices would match#e90 book values. He said#e92 all three non-food operations are profitable#e156.

Mr. Nadeau said#e94 discussions#e95 are under way with potential purchasers of each of the units. He declined#e97 to confirm#e99 or deny#e100 reports#e101 that Provigo executive Henri Roy is trying#e102 to put#e104 together a management buy-out#e159 of the catalogue showroom unit. Mr. Roy couldn't be reached#e105.

Yvon Bussieres was named#e108 senior executive vice president and chief operating officer of Provigo, a new position. Mr. Bussieres was president and chief operating officer of Provigo's Quebec retail and wholesale grocery unit. Mr. Nadeau said#e110 he intends#e111 to remain#e113 Provigo's chief executive only until the non-food businesses are sold#e116, after a which a new chief executive will be named#e117.
