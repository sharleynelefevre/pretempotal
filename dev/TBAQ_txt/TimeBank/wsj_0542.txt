Dow Jones Extends @ Tender Offer for Rest @ Of Telerate to Nov. 6 10/30/89 WALL STREET JOURNAL (J) DJ TLR TENDER OFFERS, MERGERS, ACQUISITIONS (TNM) MEDIA, PUBLISHING, BROADCASTING, ELECTRONIC PUBLISHING (MED) NEW YORK


Dow Jones amp Co. extended#e1 its tender offer#e2 of $18 a share, or about $576 million, for the 33% of Telerate Inc. that it doesn't already own until 5#t87 p.m.#t87 EST,#t87 Nov.#t87 6#t87.

The offer#e5, which Telerate's two independent directors have rejected#e6 as inadequate, previously had been scheduled#e7 to expire#e9 at midnight#t90 Friday#t90. Dow Jones said#e10 it extended#e11 the offer#e12 to allow#e14 shareholders time to review#e17 a supplement to the Dow Jones tender offer circular that it mailed#e19 last#t91 Friday#t91.

The supplement contains various information that has been filed#e23 with the Securities and Exchange Commission since Dow Jones launched#e24 the offer#e25 on Sept.#t94 26#t94, but it doesn't change#e26 the terms and conditions of the offer#e28 except to extend#e30 its expiration date.

In Delaware Chancery Court litigation, Telerate has criticized#e31 Dow Jones for not disclosing#e32 that Telerate's management expects#e34 the company's revenue to increase#e36 by 20% annually, while Dow Jones based#e38 its projections of Telerate's performance on a 12% revenue growth forecast. In the tender offer supplement, Dow Jones discloses#e44 the different growth forecasts#e45 but says#e46 it views#e47 the 20% growth rate "as a hoped-for goal" of Telerate's management "and not as a realistic basis on which to project the company's likely future performance."

Telerate shares fell#e52 50 cents on Friday#t98 to close#e54 at $20 each in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. Dow Jones shares also fell#e55 50 cents to close#e57 at $36.125 in Big Board composite trading.

Dow Jones has said#e58 it believes#e59 the $18-a-share price is fair#e101 to Telerate's minority shareholders. Late#t102 last#t102 week#t102, representatives of Dow Jones and Telerate began#e60 negotiations#e61 about the terms of the offer#e103, but those talks#e63 didn't result in any changes#e66 in the offer.
