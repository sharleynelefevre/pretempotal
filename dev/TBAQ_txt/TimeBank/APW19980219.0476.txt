Cambodian resistance general looking for remains of missing Briton

O'SMACH, Cambodia (AP)_ The top commander of a Cambodian resistance force said#e1 Thursday#t2443 he has sent#e2 a team to recover#e4 the remains of a British mine removal expert kidnapped#e5 and presumed#e146 killed#e7 by Khmer Rouge guerrillas almost#t130 two#t130 years#t130 ago#t130. Gen. Nhek Bunchhay, a loyalist of ousted Cambodian Prime Minister Prince Norodom Ranariddh, said#e9 in an interview#e10 with The Associated Press at his hilltop headquarters that he hopes#e12 to recover#e14 the remains of Christopher Howes within the#t133 next#t133 two#t133 weeks#t133. Howes had been working#e15 for the Britain-based Mines Advisory Group when he was abducted#e148 with his Cambodian interpreter Houn Hourth in March#t134 1996#t134. There were many conflicting accounts of his fate#e18. Howes' team was clearing#e150 mines 17 kilometers (10 miles) from Angkor Wat, the fabled 11th#t1000 century#t1000 temple that is Cambodia's main tourist attraction, when it was attacked#e21. In January#t135 this#t135 year#t135, British police officers who had been searching#e22 for Howes concluded#e23 he had probably been killed#e24 soon after being captured#e26. The Foreign Office said#e27 it had informed#e28 the family of Howes, 37 years old when he was kidnapped#e30, that he probably died#e31 within weeks#t137 or#t137 months#t137 of his capture#e32 on March#t136 26,#t136 1996#t136. ``Obviously, it is deeply discouraging#e33 for the family after 22#t138 months#t138, but there is no proof of life. But there is no evidence in either direction _ that there is proof of life or death,'' said#e40 a Foreign Office spokesman, speaking#e41 with customary anonymity. ``We will continue#e42 to do#e2446 everything we can to establish#e48 what has happened#e49.'' Thai military officials who monitor Cambodian affairs said#e52 privately Thursday#t2449 that Britain, through its embassies in Thailand and Cambodia, has been pushing#e53 hard to resolve#e55 the Howes case as the second anniversary#e2447 of his abduction#e56 nears. Nhek Bunchhay, who had been closely involved#e58 in the search#e59 for Howes before having to flee#e64 the Cambodian capital after a coup#e160 d'etat last#t131 year#t131, appeared#e65 confident he would find#e66 Howes' remains. He said#e68 he received#e69 information from Khmer Rouge guerrillas on where the body had been buried#e71, and recently ordered#e72 10 of his men from a force of 500 near Khmer Rouge headquarters in Anlong Veng to conduct#e162 the search#e76. If and when the remains are found#e78, he said#e79, they would be turned#e80 over to the British Embassy, apparently meaning they would be sent#e83 across the border into Thailand and onward to Bangkok. Nhek Bunchhay said#e85 he now#t2452 believed#e2227 Howes had been killed#e87 within a#t140 week#t140 of his capture#e88 by a Khmer Rouge faction loyal to Pol Pot, then the guerrilla group's leader. Pol Pot is considered#e89 responsible#e164 for the radical policies#e2396 that led#e90 to the deaths#e91 of as many as 1.7 million Cambodians when the communist group held#e93 power in the#t142 late#t142 1970s#t142. At the time Howes was captured#e94, the Khmer Rouge were a more or less united guerrilla force with more than 10,000 men under arms. But the group began#e95 to fall#e166 apart in mid-1996#t143 after the defection#e96 of one of its top leaders, Ieng Sary. Other commanders, and thousands of guerrillas, followed#e98 him. A small hardcore group under Pol Pot continued#e99 to hold#e101 out at their headquarters at Anlong Veng in northern Cambodia near the Thai border. But in June#t2228 last#t2228 year#t2228, the remaining leadership had a falling#e103 out, and Pol Pot was arrested#e104. In July#t169 last#t169 year#t169 in Phnom Penh, Cambodia's capital, Second Prime Minister Hun Sen staged#e105 a successful coup#e2448 d'etat against First Prime Minister Prince Norodom Ranariddh. Ranariddh's loyalists, including Nhek Bunchhay, his top military commander, went#e106 into hiding or fled#e109 the capital. Nhek Bunchhay, evading#e110 an intensive manhunt#e111, made#e112 his way to O'Smach, the last major outpost held by Ranariddh's forces. His men have held the stronghold _ which is on the border just opposite the Thai province of Surin _ against repeated intense attacks#e116 by Hun Sen's troops. They have been aided#e117 by Khmer Rouge guerrillas from Anlong Veng, who have formed#e118 an alliance with Ranariddh's resistance forces to oppose Hun Sen.
