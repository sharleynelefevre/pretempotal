WASHINGTON _ The economy created#e1 jobs at a surprisingly robust pace in January#t191, the government reported#e4 on Friday#t193, evidence that America's economic stamina has withstood#e6 any disruptions#e7 caused#e224 so far by the financial tumult#e228 in Asia. The Bureau of Labor Statistics said#e9 the economy added#e10 358,000 jobs last#t195 month#t195, far above the 235,000 forecast#e12 by economists. It was the third consecutive month that job generation has been exceptionally strong. With growing opportunities for work drawing#e15 more people into the labor force, the unemployment rate remained#e17 at 4.7 percent last#t196 month#t196, just a notch above its quarter-century low. The demand#e229 for workers also led#e231 employers to raise#e20 wages again last#t198 month#t198. Average hourly#t1001 earnings of production and nonsupervisory employees rose#e23 4 cents, to $12.51. The gain left#e24 wages 3.8 percent higher than a#t199 year#t199 earlier#t199, extending#e26 a trend#e2018 that has given#e27 back to workers some of the earning power they lost#e28 to inflation in the#t200 last#t200 decade#t200. But economists said#e30 the wage increase#e31 was not enough to raise#e32 any concerns about higher inflation. And because the Federal Reserve has made#e34 clear that it expects#e35 the economy to slow#e37 in coming#t201 months#t201 as ripple effects from Asia reach#e232 the United States, investors disregarded#e39 the large jobs gains, betting#e40 that neither a rise#e41 in interest rates nor resurgent inflation#e43 is looming#e44. Stocks rose#e45, pushing#e46 the Dow Jones industrial average up 72.24 points, to 8,189.49, leaving#e47 the index within 70 points of its record high set on Aug.#t202 6#t202. In the bond market, a sensitive barometer of inflation anxiety, prices edged#e52 up, pushing#e53 down the yield on the benchmark 30-year#t500 Treasury bond to 5.92 percent from 5.93 percent. ``Job creation#e55 is sturdy and we have effective price stability,'' said#e57 Paul McCulley, an economist at UBS Securities. ``The bottom line is that we've got a lovely economy.'' With potential inflation counterbalanced#e61 by worries about possible price declines#e246, the Fed and its chairman, Alan Greenspan, have suggested#e62 that they intend#e63 to keep#e65 interest rates unchanged until the economy tilts#e66 clearly in one direction or another. The job figures for January#t203 extended#e69 a surge#e70 in employment gains#e250 that began#e72 last#t204 fall#t204, just when the labor market had showed#e75 signs of cooling. After accounting#e78 for a small downward revision#e395 Friday#t205 to December#t206's figures, the economy has been creating#e81 jobs at a rate of 358,000 a month for the#t207 last#t207 four#t207 months#t207 _ and 381,000 over the#t208 last#t208 three#t208 months#t208 _ after averaging#e85 242,000 for the#t212 first#t212 nine#t212 months#t212 of 1997#t211. The surge in jobs reflects#e89 a remarkable confluence of positive and self-reinforcing economic forces. Inflation has been almost nonexistent, and consumer confidence has been extremely strong. After a short, sharp drop#e251 when Asia's financial problems first became#e93 clear, the stock market has rebounded#e95 and corporate profits have remained#e96 healthy. Long-term interest rates, an important indicator of economic stability, have fallen#e98 in the#t213 last#t213 few#t213 months#t213. Lower rates have helped#e99 invigorate#e100 housing and other interest-sensitive sectors of the economy by making#e101 loans more affordable, and have allowed#e102 companies to continue#e104 investing#e105 heavily in more efficient equipment. The likelihood that the federal budget will soon move#e107 from deficit into surplus has further improved#e109 the outlook. The less money the government needs to borrow, the more is freed for private investment. President Clinton welcomed#e115 the job figures at a news conference#e254 Friday#t2181. His advisers said#e117 the results reflected#e256 not just from balancing#e122 the budget, but also initiatives#e257 like improved access to education and training and the opening of foreign markets to trade. ``There are enormous economic and social benefits from our nation's high-employment economy,'' said Janet Yellen, the chairwoman of the White House's Council of Economic Advisers. Some of the biggest employment gains came#e134 in the construction industry, which added#e137 92,000 jobs in January#t215. The increase reflected#e140 the strength of the housing industry, which has been helped#e258 not just by declining interest rates but also by unusually warm weather. Service industries also showed#e145 solid job gains, as did manufacturers, two areas expected#e146 to be hardest hit#e148 when the effects of the Asian crisis hit#e151 the American economy. The major harm#e259 from Asia is likely to come from the plunge#e155 in the value of many Asian currencies relative to the dollar, a situation that is expected#e160 to lead#e162 to a surge#e163 of inexpensive imports into the United States, hurting#e164 American competitors. And the weakness of the Asian economies is also likely to lead#e166 to decreased demand for American exports. ``The economy has been running#e168 on the fumes of the strength from before the Asia shock,'' McCulley said#e169. ``Those fumes will exhaust#e171 themselves, and the manufacturing sector is going to start#e174 getting beat#e176 up in the spring.'' The figures showed#e178 the unemployment rate for adult men declined#e179 to 3.8 percent last#t218 month#t218 from 4.1 percent in December#t219, the lowest figure for almost two#t1002 decades#t1002. The rate for adult women rose#e181 0.4 percent, to 4.4 percent. For the first time, the Labor Department broke#e183 out unemployment by education level as well as gender, age and race. The analysis showed#e186 unemployment rates dropped#e187 steadily with higher levels of education. Among people with less than a high school education, the rate in January#t222 was 7.2 percent. Among high school graduates, the rate was 3.9 percent, and college graduates, 1.9 percent.
