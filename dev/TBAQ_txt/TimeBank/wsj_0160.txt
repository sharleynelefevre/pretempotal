Business Brief -- Savin Corp.: @ Office Products Firm Posts @ Net Loss for Third Quarter 11/02/89 WALL STREET JOURNAL (J) SVB EARNINGS (ERN)


Savin Corp. reported#e1 a third-quarter#t30 net loss#e2 of $35.2 million, or 31 cents a share, compared with year-earlier#t31 profit#e32 of $3.8 million, or one cent a share.

A spokesman for the Stamford, Conn.based company said#e4 operations had a loss#e6 of $5.5 million for the#t33 quarter#t33; in addition, the loss#e9 was magnified#e10 by nonrecurring charges totaling $23.5 million and $8.2 million in asset-valuation adjustments that he described as "unusual." The charges were partly offset#e18 by a $2 million gain#e40 on the sale#e19 of investments of two joint ventures, he said#e23.

Revenue declined#e24 8% to $85.7 million, from $93.3 million a#t38 year#t38 earlier#t38. Savin cited#e25 "a general softening#e137 in the demand for office products in the market segments in which Savin competes."
