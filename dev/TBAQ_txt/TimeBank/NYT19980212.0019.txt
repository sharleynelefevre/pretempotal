NEW YORK _ A Brooklyn woman who was watching#e1 her clothes dry in a laundromat was killed#e2 Thursday#t44 evening#t44 when two would-be robbers emptied#e4 their pistols into the store, the police said#e6. The men appeared#e7 in the store at 469 Vermont St. in Brownsville around#t46 7:15#t46 p.m.#t46, after the victim, Linda Sanders, 35, had finished#e9 her cleaning#e49 and was waiting#e10 for her clothes to dry#e11, detectives said#e12. ``It looks#e13 as though they panicked#e14,'' a detective, speaking#e15 on condition of anonymity, said#e17 of the robbers. ``They intended#e18 to rob#e19 the place. There were four or five people inside, and they just started#e20 firing#e50.'' Ms. Sanders was hit#e21 several times and was pronounced#e22 dead#e51 at the scene. The other customers fled#e25, and the police said#e26 it did not appear#e27 that anyone else was injured#e29. The men took#e30 no money from their victim or from the establishment, said#e34 Detective Joseph Pentangelo, a Police Department spokesman. Victor Miranda, who lives#e35 in Ms. Sanders' apartment building at 405 Williams Ave., said#e36 the laundry machines in the building were removed#e39 a#t47 few#t47 years#t47 ago#t47 to make#e40 room for management offices.
