Despite the recent possibility of military conflict#e26 with Iraq, oil prices have been falling#e1, that's because of a worldwide glut#e27 of oil. Now#t21 with a diplomatic solution#e28 to the crisis#e29 seemingly at hand, get set#e34 for oil prices from the Brent north sea variety to light swede crude to fall#e33 further.

Oil prices have come#e37 down from the#t22 middle#t22 of#t22 October#t22 from a twenty-two dollar barrel level down to the fourteen dollars we're seeing#e10 today#t23. That's built#e11 up a heck of a momentum and that momentum will look#e12 to increase#e13. Ah next up is that thirteen dollar a barrel level we saw#e14 in the#t24 winter#t24 of#t24 nineteen#t24 ninety-four#t24.

Weakened oil prices have already made#e15 life easier for motorists at the gas pump. Gas prices fell#e18 nearly two cents a gallon over the#t25 last#t25 two#t25 weeks#t25. That according#e39 to the Lundberg survey of ten thousand gas stations nationwide.
