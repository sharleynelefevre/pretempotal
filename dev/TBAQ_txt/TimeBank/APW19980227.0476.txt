THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP)_ The World Court Friday#t21 rejected#e1 U.S. and British objections#e1996 to a Libyan World Court case that has blocked#e2 the trial#e1997 of two Libyans suspected#e3 of blowing#e4 up a Pan Am jumbo jet over Scotland in 1988#t22. Libya, which brought#e5 the case to the United Nations' highest judicial body in its dispute#e6 with the United States and Britain, hailed#e8 the ruling#e1998 and said#e9 it would press#e10 anew for a trial#e1999 in a third neutral country. Both U.S. and British officials filed#e12 objections to the court's jurisdiction in 1995#t23, claiming#e13 Security Council resolutions imposed#e14 on Lybia to force#e15 the suspects' extradition overruled#e16 a 1971#t24 Convention which gives Libya the right to try the men. The decision, 3rd graf pvs.
