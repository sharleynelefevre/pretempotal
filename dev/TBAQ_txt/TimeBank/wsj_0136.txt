Business Brief -- Oshkosh Truck Corp.: @ Firm Says Net Fell Sharply @ In Its Fiscal Fourth Quarter 11/02/89 WALL STREET JOURNAL (J) OTRKB EARNINGS (ERN)


Oshkosh Truck Corp., Oshkosh, Wis., estimated#e17 earnings for its fourth#t2027 quarter#t2027 ended Sept.#t2023 30#t2023 fell#e2 50% to 75% below the year-earlier $4.5 million, or 51 cents a share.

The truck maker said#e3 the significant drop#e21 in net income will result#e4 in lower earnings for the#t2024 fiscal#t2024 year#t2024. In fiscal#t37 1988#t37, the company earned#e5 $17.3 million, or $1.92 a share, on revenue of $352.9 million.

Oshkosh Truck attributed#e6 the downturn#e26 in its earnings to higher start-up costs of its new chassis division, a softer motor-home market and higher administrative costs of compliance with government contractor regulations.

The company said#e7 it is in the process of phasing#e10 out John Deere, its current source of production for midsized motor home chassis. In anticipation of the start-up of its new factory, the company said#e11 a larger-than-normal chassis supply has been built#e12 to carry#e13 it through the transition period.
