PRI19980306.2000.1675 NEWS STORY


For The World, this is Pamela McCall in the BBC news room in London. More heavy gunfire#e20 in the Serbian province of Kosovo. It's the#t31 second#t31 day#t31 of an offensive#e21 by the security forces against villages populated by ethnic Albanians. BBC correspondent Karyn Coleman reports#e22 from Kosovo.

There were more accounts of people fleeing#e3 from the villages near where the offensive was taking#e5 place. They were too afraid#e24 to stay#e6, fearing#e7 the forces may also move#e8 their operations#e25 further afield. By mid#t18 afternoon#t18, official Serb sources were saying#e10 the operation#e30 was over, but that has not yet been confirmed#e11 from Belgrade, the capital of Serbia, which is where the whole attack#e27 is thought#e13 to have been planned#e14. The ethnic Albanians here in Kosovo are considerably worried#e32 about the#t19 future#t19 and fear#e35 they are witnessing#e16 the beginnings#e36 of a much wider conflict#e37.
