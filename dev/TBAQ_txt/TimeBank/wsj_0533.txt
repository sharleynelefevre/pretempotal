Two Rival Bidders @ Extend Offers @ To Buy Connaught @ ---- @ By Suzanne McGee @ Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal 10/30/89 WALL STREET JOURNAL (J) CSESF F.INM Z.CIG CHIR EUROP RHPOY CANDA TENDER OFFERS, MERGERS, ACQUISITIONS (TNM) MEDICAL AND BIOTECHNOLOGY (MTC) TORONTO


Two rival bidders for Connaught BioSciences extended#e1 their offers#e2 to acquire#e4 the Toronto-based vaccine manufacturer Friday#t102.

Institut Merieux S.A., which offered#e5 942 million Canadian dollars (US$801.2 million), or C$37 a share for Connaught, said#e6 it would extend#e7 its bid#e9, due to expire#e109 last#t103 Thursday#t103, to Nov.#t104 6#t104.

A C$30-a-share bid#e12 by Ciba-Geigy Ltd., a pharmaceutical company based in Basel, Switzerland, and California-based Chiron Corp., a bioresearch concern, was extended#e14 to Nov.#t107 16#t107. It had been due to expire#e111 Friday#t112 evening#t112.

Merieux previously said#e17 it would ensure#e18 its bid remained#e21 open pending a final decision#e118 by Canadian regulators on whether to approve#e119 the takeover#e26. Merieux, a vaccine and bioresearch firm based in Lyon, France, is controlled 50.1% by state-owned Rhone Poulenc S.A.

The Canadian government previously said#e30 Merieux's bid didn't offer#e32 enough "net benefit" to Canada to be approved, and gave#e36 Merieux an until mid-November#t122 to submit#e38 additional information.

Merieux officials said#e40 last#t124 week#t124 that they are "highly confident" the offer will be approved#e42 once it submits#e43 details of its proposed investments to federal regulators.

Both offers are conditional on regulatory approvals and enough shares being tendered to give the bidders a majority of Connaught's shares outstanding.

Institut Merieux, which already holds a 12.5% stake in Connaught, said#e54 that at the close#e55 of business Thursday#t127, 5,745,188 shares of Connaught and C$44.3 million face amount of debentures, convertible into 1,826,596 common shares, had been tendered#e60 to its offer#e61. At the close#e62 of business Thursday#t128, Ciba-Geigy and Chiron said#e64 11,580 common shares had been tendered#e65 to their offer#e66. At last report#e67, Connaught had#e129 21.8 million shares outstanding.

Separately, the Ontario Supreme Court said#e68 it will postpone#e69 indefinitely a ruling#e70 on the lawsuit launched#e73 by the University of Toronto against Connaught in connection with the Merieux bid.

In a statement prepared by lawyers for the university and Connaught, the parties said#e78 they agreed#e79 that as a result of reaching#e81 a C415 million research accord, "It is unnecessary that there be a judgment on the merits {of the case} at this time."

Lawyers for the two sides weren't immediately available for comment.

The university had sought#e88 an injunction blocking Connaught's board from recommending#e92 or supporting#e93 an offer#e94 for the company by Merieux.
