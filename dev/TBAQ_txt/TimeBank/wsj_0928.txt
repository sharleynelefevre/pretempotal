Sun Microsystems Inc. @ Posts 1st-Quarter Net @ Totaling $5.2 Million 10/26/89 WALL STREET JOURNAL (J) SUNW EARNINGS (ERN) COMPUTERS AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (CPR) MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif.


Sun Microsystems Inc., snapping#e1 back to profitability after its first quarterly loss#e2 as a public firm, said#e4 it earned#e5 $5.2 million, or seven cents a share, in the#t64 fiscal#t64 first#t64 quarter#t64.

Sun, a maker of computer workstations, reported#e6 sales of $538.5 million for the#t68 quarter#t68 ended Sept.#t69 29#t69, up 39% from $388.5 million a#t73 year#t73 earlier#t73. In the#t74 1988#t74 period#t74, the company earned#e8 $20.6 million, or 26 cents a share.

Sun's results were slightly better than expectations. Earlier this#t77 month#t77, the company said#e10 it expected#e11 to break#e13 even for the#t78 quarter#t78 on sales of $530 million.

In a statement, Scott McNealy, Sun's chief executive officer, said#e16 the company's performance was hampered#e18 by problems tied to the introduction#e20 of a major new family of computers in April#t83. One of those new computers, called Sparcstation 1, accounted#e239 for nearly half of the 28,000 systems Sun shipped#e23 in the#t84 quarter#t84, he said#e24. More than two-thirds of the systems shipped#e25, meanwhile, were products introduced#e26 in April#t87.

But problems in manufacturing, forecasting demand and getting the bugs out of a new management information system made#e32 it extremely difficult for Sun to meet#e34 demand for its newest computers well into the#t89 summer#t89. These problems also resulted#e36 in Sun reporting#e37 a $20.3 million loss#e38 for its#t94 fourth#t94 quarter#t94 ended June#t95 30#t95.

Mr. McNealy said#e40 the issues that hurt#e41 Sun's performance earlier this#t96 year#t96 are now " largely" behind the firm, and he indicated#e44 that Sun's profitability should increase#e45 throughout the#t99 fiscal#t99 year#t99.

Sun also reported#e47 a record backlog of orders. While this indicates continued strong demand#e50 for the company's desk-top computers, Sun faces#e51 increasing competition from Digital Equipment Corp. and Hewlett-Packard Co. Recently#t101, analysts have said#e54 Sun also is vulnerable#e102 to competition from International Business Machines Corp., which plans#e56 to introduce#e58 a group of workstations early#t103 next#t103 year#t103, and Next Inc.
