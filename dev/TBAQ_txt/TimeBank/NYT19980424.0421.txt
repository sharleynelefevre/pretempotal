EDITORIAL: THE COURT RETREATS ON STEREOTYPES
UR (af) LR QL UR c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service QC LR QL


The New York Times said#e1 in an editorial on Saturday,#t74 April#t74 25#t74: The Supreme Court took#e4 a detour this#t75 week#t75 from the core principle of gender fairness it vindicated#e5 two#t76 years#t76 ago#t76 in its ruling#e2031 invalidating#e8 the use#e2040 of sexual stereotypes to justify denying women admission to the Virginia Military Institute. By a 6-3 vote, the court upheld#e11 a discriminatory immigration law that gives a child born overseas to an unmarried American woman a better chance at citizenship than a child born to an unmarried American man. Under the statute, a child born abroad to an unwed American mother is automatically considered a U.S. citizen. But the child of an unwed American father has no citizenship rights unless the father takes the affirmative step of acknowledging paternity and formally agrees to provide support until the child turns 18. The majority's views were expressed#e24 in three separate opinions, the most disquieting of which was written#e25 by a liberal member, Justice John Paul Stevens, and joined#e26 by a conservative, Chief Justice William Rehnquist. The opinion, which found#e27 the gender distinction reasonable, relied#e28 heavily on outmoded generalities about family roles, including the flawed presumption that mothers have a closer relationship to their children than fathers do. As Justice Stephen Breyer asked#e32 in a strong dissent#e33, ``what sense does it make'' to apply citizenship barriers ``only to fathers and not to mothers in today's world _ where paternity can readily be proved and where women and men both are likely to earn a living in the workplace?''. Justices Sandra Day O'Connor and Anthony Kennedy seemed to agree#e43 that the law amounted#e44 to unconstitutional sex discrimination. Butinstead of providing#e45 the votes to strike#e46 it down, they chose#e47 to uphold#e48 it on the flimsy ground that because the sex of the parent and not the child made the difference under the law, the plaintiff did not have standing to bring#e52 the case. The Justice Department, which supported#e53 the statute, did not cover#e54 itself with glory either. The department retreated#e56 from its position in the VMI case when it argued#e59 that the government could not make#e60 policy#e2004 based on stereotypes ``even when those stereotypes reflect#e65 current#t77 realities.'' As for the court, it managed#e66 with its splintered ruling to cast#e67 doubt both on the constitutionality of the immigration provisions it upheld and on its true commitment to fighting gender stereotypes.
