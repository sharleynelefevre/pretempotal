Tomorrow#t135 the board of supervisors of Loudon county, Virginia, will vote#e136 on whether a school now#t138 located#e3 in Mount Vernon can relocate#e4 to their county. In some respects, that's typical county business, but tomorrow#t139's vote#e8 has international implications. The board will decide#e10 whether the Islamic Saudi Academy, funded#e11 by the government of Saudi Arabia, can move#e12 to Ashburn village, Virginia. But local residents have not exactly laid#e14 out the red carpet for their would be neighbors. The World's Nancy Marshalll has#e3000 our story.

Inside the Islamic Saudi academy in Mount Vernon, Virginia, many of the girls wear head scarves and some of the neatly dressed children are in uniforms. The instruction is in English for most classes, in Arabic for language and religious studies. The school says it teaches the children to be good Muslims and good students. They're learning a civics lesson from the residents of Loudon county. The Islamic Saudi Academy has twelve hundred mostly American students but would take#e29 thirty-five hundred if it had#e32 the room. The academy bought#e33 a hundred acres in Loudon county, Virginia, and asked#e34 for permission to build#e37 a fifty million dollar campus. In the nearby suburban housing tracts, someone dropped#e38 off leaflets warning#e39 the school could bring#e40 thousands of Middle Eastern strangers and terrorists. Some residents of the mostly white, mostly middle class area became#e42 alarmed. James Zogby of the Arab American Institute says#e147 it's a familiar story.

There is, a- at a very deep level in our culture, um I think#e146, a sense of, of ignorance about Islam, a fear about who Muslims are and what they're doing.

Many local residents denounced#e50 the bigotry, but opposition to the school then shifted#e52. Now#t346 critics of the academy are targeting#e53 its owner, the Saudi government. Pastor James Allmen of the fellowship church and school in Ashburn has led#e54 the anti-Saudi campaign#e55. James Allmen says#e56 he has#e57 no problem with a privately funded academy, but he has#e59 a big problem with a Saudi funded school.

The Saudi Arabian government has an atrocious record on human rights and is known to be one of the worst offending countries when it comes to religious persecution.

That's correct.

And that is a condition of the application, then.

At a public hearing#e69 on the Islamic Saudi Academy's application, the split#e71 in county opinion was obvious, supporters of the academy, including Ann Robinson, said#e72 the Saudis were just providing#e73 a service and it was unfair#e153 to penalize#e76 children.

We do not further#e155 the purpose of human rights in the world by violating#e78 the human rights under our own constitution.

But opponents said#e80 the school might be a target for terrorist attacks#e83, complained#e84 about its tax exempt status, and wondered#e85 why the Saudis are not compelled#e86 to allow#e89 Christians to worship#e90 in their country. Virginia Welch delivered#e91 this message to the county board of supervisors.

I urge#e94 you to do#e96 the right thing and send#e98 a message to the Saudis that the citizens of Loudon county embrace#e100 religious and human freedom.

Loudon county officials say#e101 they'll rule#e102 on the application based only on land use issues and ignore#e108 all the other objections. What's really behind those objections, some say#e111, is Loudon county's collision#e112 with a new reality in America that the country is changing#e160 religiously as surely as it is racially and ethnically. According#e161 to the Arab American institute, Islam will one#t163 day#t163 be the second largest religion in the country. For an indication of the problems that could face Muslims as they integrate into American life, one need look no farther than Loudon county, Virginia. For The World, I'm Nancy Marshalll.
