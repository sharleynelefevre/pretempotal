Business Brief -- Amdahl Corp.: @ Computer Firm's Earnings @ Fell 37% in Third Quarter 10/26/89 WALL STREET JOURNAL (J) AMH EARNINGS (ERN) COMPUTERS AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (CPR)


Amdahl Corp., a maker of mainframe computers, reported#e1 a sharp decline#e16 in net income#e31 for its third#t17 quarter#t17, citing#e2 pricecutting#e18 by competitors and adverse effects from a strong U.S. dollar.

Net income fell#e3 37% to $32.9 million, or 30 cents a share, from $52.2 million, or 48 cents a share, in the#t21 year-ago#t21 period#t21. Revenue rose#e4 15% to $534.3 million from $464.7 million.

Amdahl's results#e5 were somewhat worse than expected. Jay Stevens, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds, said he expected#e8 the Sunnyvale, Calif., company to earn 35 cents a share for the#t22 quarter#t22 and said#e11 the firm's weaker profit was partly the result#e12 of increased competition from International Business Machines Corp., Amdahl's principal competitor for mainframe sales.
