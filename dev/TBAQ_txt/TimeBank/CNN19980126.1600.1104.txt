Major job cuts at AT and T. The long distance giant slashing#e1 up to eighteen thousand jobs, freezing executive salaries and shaking#e3 up management. The changes#e39 are part of a one point six billion dollar cost cutting initiative to revitalize#e4 its position in the telecommunications business. Earlier AT and T also announced#e7 an eighteen percent drop#e42 in profits for the#t32 fourth#t32 quarter#t32. The company's sales force applauded#e9 the shake up.

It's not something we're not used#e206 to in the industry. But I think#e14 right now#t34, for AT and T and the people here, it's fairly intense#e46 as you might w- well imagine.

I mean look at the stock. You know, since he's been here the stock skyrocketed#e22 so, Yeah I think#e48 he's doing#e24 the right thing.

I think#e25 it's a good thing that they're finally going to be downsizing#e27 you know some management because there is a whole lot of waste.

Good news for AT and T today#t33. I think#e29 it's excellent#e204 for the company.

But investors are approaching#e30 the changes#e52 with caution shares of AT and T down nearly four at sixty-one and a half.
