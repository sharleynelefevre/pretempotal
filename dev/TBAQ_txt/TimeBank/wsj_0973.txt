Westinghouse @ Sees Big Gains @ For Next Year @ --- @ Boost in Operating Margins, @ Double-Digit Per-Share @ Growth Forecast by Firm @ ---- @ By Gregory Stricharchuk @ Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal 10/26/89 WALL STREET JOURNAL (J) WX ELECTRICAL COMPONENTS AND EQUIPMENT (ELQ) NEW YORK


Westinghouse Electric Corp., capitalizing#e1 on a major restructuring program, expects#e3 operating margins of more than 10% and double-digit per-share earnings growth next#t119 year#t119, top officers told#e4 securities analysts here.

John C. Marous, chairman and chief executive officer, also said#e6 the company expects#e7 sales from continuing businesses to rise#e12 8.5% annually through the#t121 next#t121 three#t121 years#t121.

In 1988#t122, the company earned#e13 $822.8 million, or $5.66 a share, on sales of $12.49 billion.

Since 1983#t126, Westinghouse has shed#e15 70 businesses that it didn't expect#e17 to produce#e20 10% operating margins while acquiring#e22 55 businesses.

In the#t127 past#t127 20#t127 months#t127 alone, Paul E. Lego, president and chief operating officer, said#e24 the divestiture of $300 million of slow-growth, low-profit businesses has been more than offset#e467 by $600 million in profitable acquisitions.

Westinghouse expects#e31 to meet#e33 its corporate goals despite a softening in the economy. Even if the gross national product is either flat or in the growth range of 2% to 2.5%, "we can handle#e37 that," Mr. Marous said#e39. GNP is the total value of the nation's output of goods and services.

A bright spot is the company's power-generation business, which is experiencing#e44 a surge of growth#e134 for the first time in years#t136. Mr. Marous said#e47 the business will achieve#e49 higher sales this#t137 year#t137 than the company's target goal of 8.5%.

While Westinghouse hasn't had#e138 a nuclear power plant order from a U.S. utility in about#t141 a#t141 decade#t141, excess capacity is beginning#e52 to shrink#e54. Mr. Lego said#e55 the company foresees#e56 the need for a major boost#e57 in new-generation capability throughout the#t144 1990s#t144.

Westinghouse also is well positioned#e58 to sell#e60 steam turbine and gas turbine plants to independent power producers. The company's ability to respond to energy needs world-wide will be enhanced#e65 through a recently#t145 announced venture#e66 with Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Mr. Lego said#e68.

He said#e69 the independent power segment could grow#e70 to provide#e73 as much as 50% of near-term generation capacity, adding#e74: "We expect#e75 to supply#e77 a significant share of this market."

Westinghouse also expects#e79 its international sales to soon#t147 grow#e81 to 25% of total corporate sales from 20% last#t150 year#t150. The company is negotiating#e82 with the Soviets to build#e84 a Thermo King truck-refrigeration plant that would produce#e85 about 10,000 units annually.

Mr. Marous said#e87 Westinghouse would own#e154 70% of the facility. The deal#e466, which will involve#e89 an initial $20 million investment#e90, was struck#e91 with a handshake#e155, he added#e93.

Company officials also said#e94 that any gain from the sale#e95 of Westinghouse's 55% stake in its transmission and distribution venture with the Swiss firm of Asea Brown Boveri will be offset#e101 by a restructuring charge in the#t157 fourth#t157 quarter#t157. The executives didn't disclose#e102 the size of the expected gain.

Capital expenditure in 1990#t158 will rise#e105 slightly, Mr. Marous said#e106, from an estimated $470 million this#t163 year#t163.
