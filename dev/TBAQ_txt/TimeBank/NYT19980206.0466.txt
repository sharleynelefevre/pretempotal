WASHINGTON _ Following are statements made Friday#t30 and Thursday#t31 by Lawrence Wechsler, a lawyer for the White House secretary, Betty Currie; the White House; White House spokesman Mike McCurry, and President Clinton in response to an article in The New York Times on Friday#t32 about her statements#e44 regarding a meeting with the president: Wechsler on Thursday#t33 ``Without commenting on the allegations raised#e8 in this article, to the extent that there is any implication or suggestion that Mrs. Currie was aware#e50 of any legal or ethical impropriety by anyone, that implication or suggestion is entirely inaccurate.'' White House on Thursday#t34 ``For the#t35 past#t35 few#t35 weeks#t35 we've been subjected#e11 to false leaks designed#e57 to mislead#e13 both reporters and the American public. We're not going to dignify#e16 the latest false leak#e58 with a response#e59.'' McCurry on Friday#t37 ``I want#e17 to be absolutely clear#e60, to the extent there is any implication#e61 or the slightest suggestion#e62 that Mrs. Currie believes#e18 that the President or anyone else tried#e19 to influence#e20 her recollection, that is absolutely false and a mischaracterization#e65 of the facts. I am shocked#e21 and dismayed#e66 by the numerous leaks#e67 regarding Mrs. Currie's grand jury testimony#e69.'' Clinton on Friday#t38. ``Once again, I never asked#e23 anybody to do#e24 anything but tell#e25 the truth. I know#e26 about the stories today#t39. I was pleased#e80 that Ms. Currie's lawyers stated#e27 unambiguously this#t40 morning#t40 _ unambiguously _ that she's not aware#e81 of any unethical conduct#e83.
