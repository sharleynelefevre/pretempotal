Qantas to run daily flights between Australia and India


CANBERRA, Australia (AP)_ Qantas will almost double#e1 its flights between Australia and India by August#t43 in the search#e2 for new markets untouched by the crippling Asian financial crisis#e26. This move#e28 comes barely a#t44 month#t44 after Qantas suspended#e5 a number of services between Australia, Indonesia, Thailand and Malaysia in the wake of the Asian economic crisis#e30. The airline has also cut#e7 all flights to South Korea. Qantas plans#e8 daily flights between Sydney and Bombay, up from the current#t46 four flights a week, to boost#e9 business and tourism ties with India, the airline announced#e10 Friday#t47. In a joint statement with Tourism Minister Andrew Thomson, it said#e11 two new flights would leave#e12 Bombay on Monday#t190 and Tuesday#t189 nights#t189 from March#t56 30#t56, with the third departing#e65 each#t54 Thursday#t54 from August#t55 6#t55. This will add#e14 nearly 700 seats a week on the route. Thomson, in India to talk#e16 to tourism leaders, said#e17 the flights would provide#e18 extra support to the growing tourism market. Qantas' India manager Khursheed Lam said#e20 the airline was working#e21 closely with the Australian Tourist Commission to develop#e22 greater awareness of Australia in the Indian market. Qantas will also appoint#e25 a Bombay-based public relations consultant.
