VOA19980303.1600.2745 NEWS STORY


While the expansion#e1 of the Internet has been a blessing#e2 for researchers, students and the just plain curious, the new opportunities mentioned#e3 by Mr. Gates are also being used#e4 by some rather unsavory characters. A new report says#e6 there has been a dramatic rise#e7 in the growth#e102 of hate groups in the United States over the#t168 past#t168 year#t168. And many of them are using#e10 the Internet to spread#e12 their messages of racial superiority. VOA's Jim Teple has details from our southeast news bureau.

The Southern Poverty Law Center, a civil rights monitoring group based in Montgomery, Alabama, has long monitored#e107 such groups as the Ku Klux Klan. More#t109 recently#t109 it has followed#e18 the growth#e110 of the militia movement and church groups that preach a message of white supremacy and anti-semitism. The new study written by Mark Potach, who edits the Southern Poverty Law Center's Intelligence Report, warns#e25 that such groups grew#e26 rapidly last#t111 year#t111, mostly by recruiting#e27 younger members. Mr. Potach says#e28 the growth#e113 is surprising#e112 since membership in hate groups usually declines during periods of economic prosperity.

We in fact have seen#e34 hate group numbers dropping#e37 through the#t115 nineties#t115, uh but this#t116 year#t116 they jumped#e38 up uh twenty percent, quite a dramatic rise#e39.

Mark Potach says#e40 over four hundred hate groups have been identified#e42 and many are becoming#e43 increasingly successful#e118 at recruiting younger members through the use#e46 of Internet web pages and the promotion of racist rock music.

The Internet has certainly helped#e49 uh hate mongers to organize#e52 and uh to feel#e54 that they are part of a larger community, even if uh they are essentially uh, you know, angry people sitting in their bedrooms uh all alone. Uh, in addition, white power racist music has become#e60 uh quite popular in certain sectors. Uh, there are over fifty thousand CDs a#t120 year#t120 sold#e61 with uh lyrics that are quite uh unbelievable.

Many of these new members are joining#e63 chapters of the so called Christian Identity Movement which cites Biblical scripture as a foundation for a belief in white supremacy and anti-semitism. Mark Potach says#e67 such members are also intensely attracted#e68 to apocalyptical fantasies.

The approach#e72 of the#t121 year#t121 two#t121 thousand#t121 has many of these groups in a kind of millennial frenzy. Uh, uh a- they believe#e74, or at least many of them believe#e75, uh that they are approaching#e76 the Battle of Armageddon in which they will be pitted against the uh kind of Satanic forces trying#e77 to take#e80 over the world.

Mr. Potach notes#e81 older, more traditional groups like the Ku Klux Klan are also opening#e82 new chapters, thanks in part to their ability#e124 to use#e87 new technologies like the Internet. The Federal Bureau of Investigation says#e89 it received#e90 more than eight thousand reports#e125 of hate group crimes#e93 last#t126 year#t126. Law enforcement authorities say#e94 such reports are likely to increase#e97 as police departments are now#t129 beginning#e98 to more accurately report#e130 hate crimes#e100 than they have#e101 in the#t133 past#t133.
