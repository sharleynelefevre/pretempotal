Poughkeepsie Savings @ Abandons Plan to Sell @ South Carolina Offices 10/27/89 WALL STREET JOURNAL (J) PKPS TENDER OFFERS, MERGERS, ACQUISITIONS (TNM) POUGHKEEPSIE, N.Y.


Poughkeepsie Savings Bank said#e1 a plan#e51 to sell#e3 its South Carolina branch offices to First Citizens Bank, of Columbia, S.C., fell#e4 through.

Poughkeepsie also expects#e5 to post#e7 a one-time charge of $8.3 million, resulting#e8 in a net loss#e9 for the#t62 third#t62 quarter#t62. The charge represents a write-down of the goodwill associated with Poughkeepsie's investment in the banks it is trying#e15 to sell#e17 and its North Carolina branches as well.

The thrift announced#e18 the plan Aug.#t63 21#t63. Among other reasons, high fees regulators imposed on certain transfers of thrift deposits to commercial banks "substantially altered#e23 the economics of the transaction#e24 for both parties," Poughkeepsie said#e26.

Additionally, the bank is increasing#e27 its loan-loss reserves for the#t64 third#t64 quarter#t64 by $8.5 million before taxes.

In the#t65 year-earlier#t65 third#t65 quarter#t65, Poughkeepsie Savings had#e54 net income of $2.8 million, or 77 cents a share.

Poughkeepsie said#e30 it is continuing#e31 to try#e33 to sell#e35 itself, under a June#t66 agreement#e36 with a dissident-shareholder group. The bank also said#e37 its effort#e38 would continue#e39 past the Nov.#t67 1#t67 deadline set#e42 in that agreement#e43 and that the litigation#e44 between the two sides might resume#e45 as a result. The thrift and the holders had suspended#e48 their lawsuits#e49 as part of the agreement#e50.
