Business Brief -- Valley Federal SampL: @ California SampL Had Charge, @ Loss in the Third Quarter 11/02/89 WALL STREET JOURNAL (J) VFED EARNINGS (ERN)


Valley Federal Savings amp Loan Association took#e1 an $89.9 million charge#e1994 as it reported#e2 a third-quarter#t28 loss#e1995 of $70.7 million, or $12.09 a share.

The Van Nuys, Calif., thrift had#e3 net income of $132,000, or three cents a share, a#t29 year#t29 ago#t29.

The bulk of the pretax charge is a $62 million write-off of capitalized servicing at the mobile home financing subsidiary, which the company said#e5 had been a big drain#e6 on earnings. The company said#e7 the one-time provision#e1999 would substantially eliminate#e8 all future#t30 losses#e2000 at the unit. Valley Federal also added#e10 $18 million to realestate loan reserves and eliminated#e12 $9.9 million of good will.

The thrift said#e14 that "after these charges#e15 and assuming#e2126 no dramatic fluctuation#e1997 in interest rates, the association expects#e2001 to achieve#e20 near record earnings#e1998 in 1990#t31."

Valley Federal is currently#t2003 being examined#e21 by regulators. New loans continue#e22 to slow#e23; they were $6.6 million in the#t32 quarter#t32 compared with $361.8 million a#t33 year#t33 ago#t33. The thrift has#e25 assets of $3.2 billion.
