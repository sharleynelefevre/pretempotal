Finally today#t32, we learned#e1 that the space agency has finally taken#e2 a giant leap forward. Air Force Lieutenant Colonel Eileen Collins will be named#e3 commander#e37 of the Space Shuttle Columbia for a mission#e38 in December#t33. Colonel Collins has been the co-pilot#e40 before, but this time she's the boss#e41. Here's ABC's Ned Potter.

Even two hundred miles up in space, there has been a glass ceiling. It wasn't until twenty#t34 years#t34 after the first astronauts were chosen#e6 that NASA finally included#e7 six women, and they were all scientists, not pilots. No woman has actually been in#e254 charge of a mission until now#t55.

Just the fact that we're doing#e68 the job that we're doing makes#e44 us role models.

That was Eileen Collins, after she flew#e10 as the first ever co-pilot. Being commander is different. It means supervising the rest of the crew in training and leading them in flight. It is, in short, the kind of management job many American women say they've had to fight for. In space, some say female pilots were held#e20 up until now#t36 by the lack#e51 of piloting opportunities for them in the military.

Once Colonel Collins was picked#e22 as a NASA astronaut#e52, she followed#e23 a normal progression within NASA. Nobody hurried#e24 her up. No one held#e25 her back.

Many NASA watchers say#e26 female astronauts have become#e27 part of the agency's routine. But they still have catching#e28 up to do two hundred and thirty four Americans have flown#e30 in space, only twenty six of them women. Ned Potter, ABC News.
