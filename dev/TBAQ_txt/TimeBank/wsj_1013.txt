Columbia SampL Posts $226.3 Million Loss @ After Writing Down High-Yield Portfolio @ ---- @ By Pauline Yoshihashi @ Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal 10/26/89 WALL STREET JOURNAL (J) CSV EARNINGS (ERN) BEVERLY HILLS, Calif.


Columbia Savings amp Loan Association, reeling#e1 from thrift-accounting changes#e2 mandated#e4 by Congress and the recent collapse#e5 of the junk-bond market, announced#e7 a loss#e8 for the#t164 third#t164 quarter#t164 of $226.3 million, or $11.57 a share.

For the#t165 quarter#t165 a#t165 year#t165 ago#t165, Columbia reported#e9 earnings of $16.3 million, or 37 cents a share. Total assets increased#e10 to $12.7 billion in the#t166 latest#t166 quarter#t166 from $12.4 billion a#t167 year#t167 earlier#t167.

The loss#e11 stems#e12 from $357.5 million of write-downs#e168 on Columbia's $4.4 billion high-yield investment securities portfolio, which includes about $3.7 billion of junk bonds, $400 million of preferred stock, and Treasury securities.

Columbia owes#e15 its spectacular growth#e2022 in recent#t169 years#t169 to its junk-bond portfolio, the largest of any U.S. thrift. Much of Columbia's junk-bond trading#e17 has been done#e18 through the high-yield department of its Beverly Hills neighbor, Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.

For the#t170 nine#t170 months#t170, losses totaled#e19 $212 million, or $10.83 a share, compared with net income of $48.7 million, or $1.11 a share, a#t172 year#t172 earlier#t172.

The results include a $130.2 million write-down of the securities in the high-yield portfolio to the lower of their cost or market value.

Columbia also added#e26 $227.3 million to reserves for losses#e1990 on the portfolio, increasing#e29 general reserves to $300 million, or about 6.7% of the total portfolio, as of Sept.#t1991 30#t1991. On June#t1992 30#t1992, loss reserves stood#e31 at $108.3 million. Thrift officials said#e32 the $300 million reserve will be adjusted#e33 quarterly and will reflect#e34 the rate of dispositions and market conditions.

The adjustments result#e37 from the recently passed#e1993 thrift-industry bailout legislation, which requires#e40 thrifts to divest#e42 all high-yield bond investments by 1994#t1994. Previously, Columbia didn't have to adjust#e47 the book value of its junk-bond holdings to reflect#e50 declines#e1997 in market prices, because it held#e52 the bonds as long-term investments. Because Columbia now#t2151 must sell#e55 the bonds within five#t1999 years#t1999, accounting rules require#e58 the thrift to value#e60 the bonds at the lower of cost or market prices.

For its future strategy, Columbia officials said#e62 the thrift may branch#e2000 out into commercial lending or managing outside investments, as well as beefing#e67 up more traditional thrift activities.

The quarterly results also reflected#e70 $21.4 million in non-recurring losses from commercial real-estate activities in California.

Thomas Spiegel, Columbia's chairman, said#e73 in a statement that the thrift was " disappointed#e76" by the effects of the accounting changes#e77. But he said#e78 Columbia remains#e79 "one of the most strongly capitalized thrifts in the industry," based on the economic value of its assets and tangible capital.

Columbia announced#e84 the results after the close#e2002 of the stock market. Its shares closed#e87 at $5.125 each in composite New York Stock Exchange trading, down 37.5 cents. The price of Columbia shares has been cut#e88 nearly in half since August#t2004, when they traded#e91 at about $10, as investors apparently realized#e92 that the thrift would be forced#e93 to take#e96 a big write-down. The stock's decline#e2006 accelerated#e97 in the#t2007 past#t2007 two#t2007 weeks#t2007, from a price of $8 a share on Oct.#t2009 9#t2009.

Columbia officials said#e99 they don't know#e100 how quickly they will dispose#e102 of the thrift's junk bonds, because federal regulations, such as those that would allow#e105 thrifts to continue#e108 holding#e109 the bonds in separately capitalized subsidiaries, haven't yet been completed#e111.

Columbia officials also said#e113 the thrift shouldn't face#e114 problems meeting regulatory capital requirements, despite the large reserves and write-downs and stiffer regulatory requirements that should be in place by year's#t2012 end#t2012. Its ratio of tangible equity to total assets as of Sept.#t2013 30#t2013 was 3.6%, and total equity was $457.9 million.

The thrift emphasized#e124 that it has#e125 a large portfolio of equity securities issued#e128 in connection with corporate restructurings and leveraged buy-outs#e2015, which has#e130 a book value of $90 million.

Although many of the transactions related to those securities haven't been completed#e134, Columbia said#e136 the ultimate gain on the sale#e137 of those assets will range#e139 from $200 million to $300 million. Columbia also has#e140 unrealized gains in its public equity securities portfolio of more than $70 million.
