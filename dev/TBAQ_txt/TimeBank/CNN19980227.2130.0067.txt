Live from Atalanta, good evening Lynne Russell, CNN headline news. New evidence is suggesting#e4 that a series of bombings#e91 in Atalanta and last#t93 month#t93's explosion#e6 at an Alabama women's clinic might be related#e8. Pierre Thomas has the latest.

Atlanta nineteen#t95 ninety-six#t95. A bomb blast shocks#e11 the Olympic games. One person is killed#e12.

January#t96 nineteen#t96 ninety-seven#t96. Atlanta again. This time a bomb#e149 at an abortion clinic. More people are hurt#e16. And just last#t97 month#t97, an off duty policeman is killed#e17 when a bomb explodes#e98 at another abortion clinic. Location, Birmingham, Alabama.

This man, Eric Rudolph has already been charged#e22 in the Birmingham bombing#e23. Now#t178 officials are investigating#e25 whether, Rudolph, who remains at large, is linked#e27 to all three attacks#e28. The reason, authorities have discovered#e30 tantalizing new evidence.

Steel plates recovered#e33 at the Olympic park bombing appear#e34 to match#e36 those found#e37 at the abortion clinic bombing#e38 in Atlanta. Those plates may have come#e42 from a machine shop in north Carolina, where a friend of Rudolph worked#e44.

And nails found#e45 in the Atlanta abortion clinic bombing#e101 are identical to those discovered#e46 at Rudolph's storage shed in north Carolina. A senior law enforcement source tells#e49 CNN, there is a lot of circumstantial evidence and it would be extraordinary to have#e53 all these bits and pieces and there not be a connection.

And law enforcement sources say#e54 they can't ignore#e55 letters penned under the name army of god. Army of god is a secret organization that hates abortion providers, homosexuals and the US government.

Army of god letters claim#e105 responsibility for the Atlanta abortion clinic bombing#e106, a nineteen#t107 ninety-seven#t107 attack#e61 on a gay lounge and the Birmingham assault#e63.

An intense manhunt#e64 conducted by the FBI and the bureau of alcohol, tobacco and firearms continues#e66 for Rudolph in the wilderness of western north Carolina. And this#t108 week#t108, FBI director Louie Freeh assigned#e109 more agents to the search#e67.

Freeh also ordered#e68 the investigation#e69 consolidate information under the Atlanta task force, another indication officials suspect#e72 a link between all the bombings#e73. Privately, authorities say#e74 Rudolph has become#e76 a focus of their investigation#e77. Publicly, they are unwilling#e111 to make#e79 any sweeping assertion#e80. The reason, they remember#e82 Richard Jewell. pierre thomas, CNN, Washington.
