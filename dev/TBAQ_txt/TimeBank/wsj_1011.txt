Delta Air Net Rose @ By 33% to Record @ In Fiscal 1st Period @ ---- @ By Bridget O'Brian @ Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal 10/26/89 WALL STREET JOURNAL (J) DAL AWAL EARNINGS (ERN) AIRLINES (AIR)


Delta Air Lines earnings soared#e1 33% to a record in the#t58 fiscal#t58 first#t58 quarter#t58, bucking#e3 the industry trend toward declining profits.

The Atlanta-based airline, the third largest in the U.S., attributed#e5 the increase#e6 to higher passenger traffic, new international routes and reduced service by rival Eastern Airlines, which is in bankruptcy proceedings#e9 in the wake of a strike#e12 that began#e13 last#t60 spring#t60.

For the#t65 quarter#t65 ended Sept.#t63 30#t63, Delta posted#e15 net income of $133.1 million, or $2.53 a share, up from $100 million, or $2.03 a share, a#t64 year#t64 earlier#t64.

Revenue rose#e16 15% to $2.17 billion from $1.89 billion. During the#t70 quarter#t70, Delta issued#e17 2.5 million shares of common stock to Swissair, and repurchased#e18 1.1 million shares for use#e19 in a company employee stock ownership plan.

"The key to Delta's record earnings continued#e21 to be excellent passenger revenue growth#e95," said#e23 Thomas Roeck, chief financial officer. Passenger traffic jumped#e25 14% in the quarter, while profit per passenger grew#e27 2%.

Delta has benefited#e28 more than other carriers from the weakness of Eastern Airlines, which shares#e29 the Atlanta hub. Although Eastern is back to about 80% of its pre-strike schedule now#t73, the Texas Air Corp. subsidiary was only beginning#e31 to get#e33 back on its feet during the#t74 quarter#t74.

Separately, America West Airlines, Phoenix, Ariz., reported#e34 third-quarter#t79 profit jumped#e35 45% to $5.8 million, or 28 cents a share, from $4 million, or 24 cents a share, a#t88 year#t88 earlier#t88. The latest results include a $2.6 million one-time payment#e77 from a "foreign entity." America West wouldn't identify#e38 the entity, but said#e41 the payment#e42 was for the foreign company's use#e43 of certain tax benefits in connection with America West plane purchases. Year-earlier#t80 results#e44 included an extraordinary gain#e82 of $1.6 million from a buy-back of convertible subordinated debentures.

Revenue rose#e48 21% to $243.4 million from $201.2 million. For the#t87 nine#t87 months#t87, America West posted#e49 earnings of $18.9 million, or 97 cents a share, compared with a loss#e51 of $9.7 million, or 74 cents a share, a#t89 year#t89 earlier#t89. Revenue rose#e52 27% to $715.1 million from $563.8 million.
