BellSouth, LIN @ Sweeten Plan @ To Merge Lines @ --- @ Accord Involves Huge Debt @ And May Fail to Thwart @ Rival Suitor McCaw @ ---- @ By Julie Amparano Lopez @ Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal 10/30/89 WALL STREET JOURNAL (J) BLS LINB MCAWA TENDER OFFERS, MERGERS, ACQUISITIONS (TNM) TELEPHONE SYSTEMS (TLS) MEDIA, PUBLISHING, BROADCASTING, ELECTRONIC PUBLISHING (MED)


The bolstered cellular agreement between BellSouth Corp. and LIN Broadcasting Corp. carries heightened risks and could fail#e4 to fend#e7 off McCaw Cellular Communications Inc., the rival suitor for LIN.

Moreover, the amended pact shows how McCaw's persistence has pushed#e10 LIN and BellSouth into a corner, forcing#e12 huge debt on the proposed new company. The debt, estimated#e13 at $4.7 billion, could mortgage#e14 the cellular company's future earning power in order to placate#e19 some LIN holders in the#t287 short#t287 term#t287.

The plan still calls#e21 for LIN to combine#e23 its cellular telephone properties with BellSouth's and to spin#e25 off its broadcasting operations. But under new terms of the agreement, announced#e28 Friday#t288, LIN holders would receive#e29 a special cash dividend of $42 a share, representing a payout of about $2.23 billion, shortly before the proposed merger#e32. LIN said#e34 it expects#e35 to borrow#e37 the money to pay#e40 the dividend, but commitments#e41 from banks still haven't been obtained#e43. Under previous terms, holders would have received#e45 a dividend of only $20 a share.

In addition, New York-based LIN would exercise#e48 its right to buy#e51 out for $1.9 billion the 55% equity interest of its partner, Metromedia Co., in a New York cellular franchise. That money also would have to be borrowed#e56. In effect, McCaw has forced#e57 LIN's hand by bidding#e58 $1.9 billion for the stake earlier#t292 this#t292 month#t292.

"We're taking#e60 on more debt than we would have liked#e61 to," acknowledged#e63 Michael Plouf, LIN's vice president and treasurer. Although he expressed#e65 confidence that the proposed new company's cash flow would be sufficient#e294 to cover#e69 interest payments on the debt, he estimated#e71 that the company wouldn't be profitable#e295 until 1994#t299 or#t299 later#t299.

Analyst estimate#e74 the value of the BellSouth proposal at about $115 to $125 a share. They value#e301 McCaw's bid#e76 at $112 to $118 a share. The previous BellSouth pact was valued#e77 at about $98 to $110 a share.

McCaw, the largest provider of cellular telephone service in the U.S., already owns about 9.4% of LIN's stock. In response to BellSouth's amended pact, the Kirkland, Wash., company extended#e81 its own offer#e82 to buy#e84 22 million LIN shares for $125 apiece, which would give#e85 McCaw a 50.3% controlling interest. Over the#t307 weekend#t307, McCaw continued#e88 to call#e90 for an auction of LIN. Analysts said#e91 they expect#e92 McCaw to escalate#e94 the bidding again.

"This game isn't over yet, " said#e98 Joel D. Gross, a vice president at Donaldson, Lufkin amp Jenrette Securities Corp. "At some point, it will become#e100 non-economical for one company. But I don't think#e101 we're at that point yet."

Under its revised proposal#e104, Atlanta-based BellSouth would have#e316 a 50% interest in the new cellular company and would be responsible#e317 for half of its debt. To sweeten#e107 the pact further -- and to ease#e110 concerns of institutional investors -- BellSouth added#e111 a provision designed to give#e115 extra protection to holders if the regional Bell company ever decides#e118 to buy#e120 the rest of the new cellular company. The provision, described as "back-end" protection, would require#e125 BellSouth to pay#e128 a price equivalent to what an outside party might have to pay.

McCaw's bid also has a similar clause. Only McCaw's proposal requires#e138 the company to begin#e140 an auction process#e141 in June#t322 1994#t322 for remaining shares at third-party prices.

To mollify#e144 shareholders concerned#e145 about the long-term value of the company under the BellSouth-LIN agreement, BellSouth also agreed#e147 to pay#e149 as much as $10 a share, or $540 million, if, after five#t326 years#t326, the trading value of the new cellular company isn't as high as the value that shareholders would have realized from the McCaw offer.

"We're very pleased#e329 with the new deal. We didn't expect#e154 BellSouth to be so responsive#e330," said#e157 Frederick A. Moran, president of Moran Asset Management Inc., which holds 500,000 LIN shares. BellSouth's "back-end protection was flawed previously. We think#e161 this is a superior deal to McCaw's. We're surprised. We didn't think#e164 a sleeping {Bell} mentality would be willing#e332 to take#e168 on dilution."

But Kenneth Leon, a telecommunications analyst with Bear, Stearns amp Co., finds#e170 the BellSouth proposal still flawed#e171 because the company doesn't have to wait#e2025 five years to begin buying more LIN shares. "How many shares will be around in 1995?" he asked. "There's nothing preventing BellSouth from buying up shares in the meanwhile."

BellSouth's revised proposal#e183 surprised#e184 many industry analysts, especially because of the company's willingness to accept#e187 some dilution of future earnings. William O. McCoy, president of the company's BellSouth Enterprises Inc. unit, said#e189 the revised agreement#e190 with LIN would dilute#e191 BellSouth earnings by about 9% in both 1990#t351 and 1991#t352 and by significantly less thereafter. Indeed, BellSouth's cellular operations were among the first in the country to become profitable.

For 1988#t358, BellSouth earned#e196 $1.7 billion, or $3.51 a share, on revenue of $13.6 billion. Analysts were predicting#e197 1990#t359 BellSouth earnings in the range of $3.90 a share, or $1.9 billion, but now#t361 those estimates#e362 are being scaled#e200 back.

In composite trading#e363 Friday#t364 on the New York Stock Exchange, BellSouth shares fell#e201 87.5 cents to $52.125.

In national over-the-counter trading#e202, LIN shares soared#e203 $4.625 to closed at $112.625, while McCaw fell#e206 $2.50 a share to $37.75.

The proposed BellSouth-LIN cellular company, including the newly acquired Metromedia stake, would give#e207 the new entity 55 million potential customers, including about 35 million in the nation's top 10 markets.

Mr. Leon of Bear Stearns speculated#e211 that McCaw, in an attempt#e212 to buy#e215 time, might consider#e217 filing#e219 an antitrust suit against BellSouth with the Justice Department and U.S. District Judge Harold Greene, who oversees enforcement of the consent decree that broke#e224 up the Bell system in 1984#t370.

Indeed, McCaw seemed#e225 to hint#e227 at that option in a brief statement#e230. Urging LIN directors to conduct "a fair auction on a level playing field," McCaw asked how well the public interest would be served "with the Bell operating companies controlling over 94% of all cellular {potential customers} in the nation's top 10 markets."
