RJR Is Selling @ Candy Brands @ For $370 Million @ ---- @ By Peter Waldman @ Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal 10/30/89 WALL STREET JOURNAL (J) RJR Z.NES TENDER OFFERS, MERGERS, ACQUISITIONS (TNM) FOOD PRODUCTS (FOD)


RJR Nabisco Inc. said#e1 it agreed#e2 to sell#e4 its Baby Ruth, Butterfinger and Pearson candy businesses to Nestle S.A.'s Nestle Foods unit for $370 million.

The sale#e5, at a higher price than some analysts had expected#e7, helps#e8 the food and tobacco giant raise#e72 funds to pay#e10 debt and boosts#e11 Nestle's 7% share of the U.S. candy market to about 12%.

The candy businesses had#e75 sales#e76 of about $154 million last#t79 year#t79, which was roughly 12% of total revenue for RJR's Planters LifeSavers unit, according#e80 to a memorandum distributed#e14 by RJR's owner, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts amp Co., to bankers last#t82 December#t82.

The Nestle acquisition includes a candy plant in Franklin Park, Ill., which employs about 800 workers.

The sale#e17, which had been expected#e18, is part of KKR's program#e83 to pay#e20 down $5 billion of a $6 billion bridge loan by February#t85. Roughly $2 billion of that debt has already been repaid#e21 from previous asset sales, and RJR expects#e23 to use#e24 another $2 billion from the pending, two-part sale#e25 of most of its Del Monte unit. That sale#e26, however, could still fall#e89 through if financing problems develop#e29. Thus, it remains crucial for RJR to obtain top dollar for its smaller assets like the candy brands.

Louis Gerstner Jr., chairman and chief executive officer of New York-based RJR, called the sale a "significant step" in the company's divestiture program, as well as a "a strategic divestiture." Since KKR bought#e38 RJR in February#t91 for $25 billion of debt, it has agreed#e39 to sell#e41 nearly $5 billion of RJR assets. RJR's executives have said#e42 they will dispense#e43 with certain brands, in particular, that aren't leaders#e93 in their markets. "RJR Nabisco and Planters LifeSavers will concentrate#e94 more on our own core businesses," Mr. Gerstner said#e50 Friday#t95.

Baby Ruth and Butterfinger are both among the top-selling 15 chocolate bars in the U.S., but RJR's overall share of the roughly $5.1 billion market is less than 5%. Nestle's share of 7% before Friday#t99's purchases#e52 is far below the shares of market leaders Hershey Foods Corp. and Mars Inc., which have about 40% and 36% of the market, respectively.

"This means Nestle is now in the candybar business in a big way," said#e61 Lisbeth Echeandia, publisher of Orlando, Fla.-based Confectioner Magazine. "For them, it makes all kinds of sense. They've been given#e64 a mandate from Switzerland" to expand#e67 their U.S. chocolate operations. Nestle S.A. is based in Vevey, Switzerland.

The new candy bars, "make#e69 an important contribution#e70 to our Nestle Foods commitment to this very important strategic unit," said#e71 C. Alan MacDonald, president of Nestle Foods in Purchase, N.Y.
