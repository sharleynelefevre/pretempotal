CAGUAS, Puerto Rico (AP)_ Kidnappers kept#e1 their promise to kill#e2 a store owner they took#e3 hostage and police found#e4 the man's dismembered and decapitated body Friday#t33 wrapped#e6 in plastic garbage bags. Police confirmed#e8 Friday#t39 that the body found#e9 along a highway in this municipality 15 miles south of San Juan belonged#e10 to Jorge Hernandez, 49. Hernandez was kidnapped#e11 from his small, neighborhood store in the town of Trujillo Alto at 10#t35 p.m.#t35 Wednesday#t35, police said#e12. His kidnappers demanded#e13 a ransom of dlrs 1 million, but negotiations#e47 broke#e14 off at noon#t36 Thursday#t36. Police gave#e15 no details about the negotiations#e48 with the kidnappers for the return#e50 of Hernandez. The store owner's body was found#e17 with the arms and head cut#e51 off and the parts stuffed#e18 in separate garbage bags. A passerby called#e20 police to report#e21 the body alongside the road. Puerto Rico Police Superintendent Pedro Toledo urged#e22 people who might be targeted#e23 by kidnappers to be alert#e25. ``There has been an increase#e26 in Puerto Rico in this kind of thing and some of these bands of kidnappers are made#e27 up of foreigners,'' Toledo said#e28. While some Latin American countries such as Mexico and Colombia have suffered#e29 from a rash of kidnappings#e276 in recent#t37 years#t37, the crime has not been common in this U.S. commonwealth.
