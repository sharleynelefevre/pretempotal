CANBERRA, Australia (AP)_#e1 Turning#e1 its back on 210#t110 years#t110 of loyalty to the British royal family, a constitutional convention voted#e2 overwhelmingly Friday#t111 to make#e4 Australia a republic under its own president. Prime Minister John Howard, a monarchist himself, promised#e5 to put#e7 the question to a national referendum#e9 next#t112 year#t112 after convention delegates voted#e10 89-52 for a republic, with 11 abstentions. Spontaneous applause#e11 echoed#e12 through the chamber and public galleries as the crucial vote#e13 passed#e14 by a wide margin. ``I want#e15 a referendum#e16,'' Howard said#e17. ``The Australian people are owed#e18 the opportunity of expressing#e19 an opinion on this.'' ``It would be a travesty#e21 in common sense terms of Australian democracy for that proposition not to be put#e24 to the Australian people,'' Howard said#e25. Even in his own Cabinet, Howard is becoming#e26 increasingly isolated#e27 with his monarchist stance. Treasurer Peter Costello, Environment Minister Robert Hill and Attorney General Daryl Williams all voted#e28 to support#e30 the republic Friday#t114. ``This convention will be seen#e31 as a turning point in our history,'' Australian Republican Movement spokeswoman Mary Delahunty said#e32. Pro-republicans hope#e33 to have#e35 an Australian president by the opening#e36 of the 2000#t121 Olympics and the 100th anniversary of Australian federation. Calling#e37 for an amended constitution with a new preamble, to be written#e41 by Australian poets, republican Janet Holmes a Court said#e115, ``We need#e42 the smell of eucalyptus in this, and the feel of red dust.'' Monarchists hope#e43 to defeat#e45 the republic at the referendum#e46. ``The phony war#e48 has finished#e49 and the real referendum campaign#e50 has clearly begun#e51,'' Australians for a Constitutional Monarchy executive director Kerry Jones said#e52. ``Well may we say#e53 `God save#e3000 the Queen,' for nothing will save the republic,'' outraged monarchist delegate David Mitchell said#e58. ``The idea of a republic will fall#e319 to dust through the grace of almighty God.'' Polls have shown#e62 public support for a republic increasing#e64, rising#e65 from about 35 percent several#t117 years#t117 ago#t117 to about 51 percent this#t358 year#t358, as pro-monarchist sentiment diminishes#e66. Australia has been independent#e374 since 1901#t118, but like many Commonwealth nations it still recognizes#e67 the British monarch as its head of state. Howard said#e68 Queen Elizabeth II is taking#e69 a great interest in the convention#e387. ``She is, I can assure#e70 you, from what I've been told#e72, she's following#e73 the thing very closely and taking#e75 the view it's our business. ``It's no secret that she's indicated#e78 to me... she is a 20th#t1000 century#t1000 democrat, understands#e79 that the role of the crown in Australia rests#e82 in the hands of the Australian people as it has#e85 for almost#t119 a#t119 hundred#t119 years#t119.'' The model for a republic, adopted#e86 over bitter objections#e87 from those advocating#e88 direct election of a president, is for presidential nominations to be made with public input and the winning candidate decided by a two-thirds majority of Parliament. Former prime minister Paul Keating, who put#e95 the republic issue in the spotlight in his unsuccessful 1996#t120 campaign#e97 for re-election, welcomed#e98 the result#e99. ``This is an important step along the path towards Australia claiming its full sovereignty, and due recognition that the monarchy can no longer serve us appropriately,'' Keating said.
