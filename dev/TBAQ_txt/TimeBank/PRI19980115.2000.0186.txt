Former savings and loan chief, Charles Keating, is facing#e1 more legal troubles in California. A federal appeals court has reinstated#e3 his state convictions#e1998 for securities fraud#e2000. NPR's Elaine Corey has more from San Francisco.

In nineteen#t30 ninety-one#t30 Charles Keating was convicted#e5 in state court of helping#e7 to defraud#e8 thousands of investors who bought#e9 high risk junk bonds sold#e10 by Keating's employees at Lincoln savings and loan. The bonds became#e11 worthless when the bankrupt thrift was seized#e13 by government regulators. Keating's convictions#e2003 were thrown#e14 out in nineteen#t31 ninety-six#t31 on a technicality. And on that basis Keating was released#e15 from prison before he was eligible#e2004 for parole#e2008. Now#t32 the ninth US circuit court of appeals has ruled#e17 that the original appeal#e2007 was flawed#e18 since it brought#e19 up issues that had not been raised#e20 before. That means#e22 the convictions stand#e23, a ruling#e2039 likely to send#e24 Keating's lawyers back to state court where they must start#e2010 over with a new appeal#e2011.
