MGM Grand to Pay @ $93 Million, Stock @ For Resort Site @ ---- @ By David J. Jefferson @ Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal 10/26/89 WALL STREET JOURNAL (J) MGMG RAM TENDER OFFERS, MERGERS, ACQUISITIONS (TNM) REAL ESTATE, REITS, LAND DEVELOPMENT (REL) CASINOS AND GAMBLING (CNO) STOCK MARKET, OFFERINGS (STK) BEVERLY HILLS, Calif.


MGM Grand Inc. has agreed#e1 to pay#e3 $93 million and nearly 1.8 million common shares to buy#e5 117 acres of land along the Las Vegas, Nev., Strip as a site for its planned movie-studio and theme-park resort.

Of the total purchase price, $50 million cash and $30 million in stock (nearly 1.8 million shares) would be paid#e8 to buy#e11 the existing 700-room Marina Hotel amp Casino from Southwest Securities, a Nevada limited partnership. The remaining properties to be acquired#e13 are the Tropicana Country Club amp Golf Course, a facility jointly owned by Ramada Inc., of Phoenix, Ariz., and the Jaffe family, and a small parcel owned by MGM Grand director James D. Aljian.

The purchase price was disclosed#e17 in a preliminary prospectus issued#e18 in connection with MGM Grand's planned offering of six million common shares. The luxury airline and casino company, 98.6%-owned by investor Kirk Kerkorian and his Tracinda Corp., earlier this#t95 month#t95 announced#e22 its agreements#e23 to acquire#e25 the properties, but didn't disclose#e26 the purchase price.

The proposed stock offering#e28 and issuance#e29 of nearly 1.8 million common shares in connection with the land purchase will bring#e32 MGM Grand's total shares outstanding to 28.7 million, of which 72% will be owned#e33 by Mr. Kerkorian and Tracinda, according#e100 to the prospectus.

In over-the-counter trading#e34, MGM Grand was bid#e35 at $17.50 a share.

Proceeds from the offering are expected#e38 to be used#e40 for remodeling#e41 the company's Desert Inn resort in Las Vegas, refurbishing#e101 certain aircraft of the MGM Grand Air unit, and to acquire#e43 the property for the new resort. The company said#e44 it estimates#e45 the Desert Inn remodeling will cost#e46 about $32 million, and the refurbishment#e103 of the three DC-8-62 aircraft, made by McDonnell Douglas Corp., will cost#e48 around $24.5 million.

MGM Grand said#e49 the latest stock offering won't cover#e51 the $600 million or more cost of building#e2188 the proposed resort and theme park, and added#e54 it will need#e55 to seek#e57 additional financing, either through bank borrowings or debt and equity offerings, at a#t104 later#t104 date#t104. Construction#e63 is set#e64 to begin#e66 in early#t105 1991#t105.

The resort will include the MGM Grand Hotel, a multi-spired, castle-like facility that will include 5,000 rooms and 85,000 square feet of casino space. The facility will be marketed#e69 toward families, and room rates will be between $35 and $55 a night, MGM Grand said#e70.

The prospectus didn't include#e71 many details about the studio and theme park, although conceptual drawings, released#e75 this#t108 month#t108, show#e76 that it may feature#e77 several "themed" areas similar to those found at parks built by Walt Disney Co.
