Iraq's Saddam Hussein, his options for ending#e400 the Persian Gulf crisis#e399 growing increasingly unpleasant, assumed#e401 the role#e462 of embattled Arab hero in offering#e403 his first rough proposal#e404 for a negotiated end#e405 to the confrontation#e406. The Iraqi leader, in an "initiative#e407" designed#e408 as much to rally#e411 Arab public opinion#e412 as to launch#e413 meaningful negotiations#e414, announced#e415 yesterday#t416 that he will withdraw#e417 his troops from Kuwait only if Israel withdraws#e418 from the West Bank and Syria from Lebanon. He apparently hopes#e419 to lure#e421 support#e422 from Arabs who have spurned#e423 him so far by suggesting#e424 that Iraq will use#e425 its occupation#e426 of Kuwait as a lever to solve#e427 the Arab world's most frustrating problem#e428, the 23-year#t500 Israeli occupation#e429 of land claimed#e430 by Palestinians.

Even as Saddam Hussein was searching#e2 for a ploy#e3 to ease#e5 his isolation, though, the international pressure#e431 against him clicked#e7 up another notch. The White House yesterday#t432 disclosed#e8 that Kuwait's ousted government has formally asked#e9 the U.S. to enforce#e11 the total trade embargo#e433 the United Nations has imposed#e12 on Iraq, allowing#e13 the U.S. and other nations to immediately begin#e15 stopping#e16 ships carrying Iraqi goods. Secretary of State James Baker, speaking#e18 on ABC News' "This Week," said#e19 the Kuwaiti request#e20 gives#e21 the U.S. and other countries "a legal basis for stopping#e22 the export#e434 of oil and that sort of thing." The U.S. maintains#e24 that under the U.N. charter, the Kuwaiti request#e25 triggers#e26 steps for the collective enforcement#e27 of international sanctions#e28. Mr. Baker declined#e29 to use#e31 the word blockade, but said#e33 that "interdiction#e34" of Iraqi shipments#e35 would begin#e435 " almost instantly." In a statement#e38, the White House said#e39 it would do#e40 "whatever is necessary" to ensure#e43 compliance with the sanctions#e45. Other Bush administration officials said#e46 that the international naval force in the area -- consisting of American, British, French, Canadian, Soviet, German and Australian ships -- may be used#e48 both to stop#e51 oil exports from leaving#e53 Iraq and Kuwait and to stop#e55 shipments of food and other goods from going#e58 in. President Bush implied#e59 as much yesterday#t437 when reporters asked#e61 whether the interdiction#e62 would apply#e63 to food. The president responded#e65, "Everything, everything." While shying#e67 away from actually using#e69 the word "blockade," Mr. Bush acknowledged#e72 that the U.S. and others were trying#e73 to block#e75 shipping#e76 to Iraq. "No point getting into all these semantics," he said#e78. "The main thing is to stop#e81 the oil from coming#e83 out of there." The naval interdiction force is part of an overall American strategy that officials say is designed to leave the Iraqi leader with only the stark choice of backing out of Kuwait or launching new attacks to change his situation. Though they insist they aren't trying#e3000 to lure Saddam Hussein into an attack, officials hope that if he strikes again, the U.S. and its allies will have such an impressive force in place in Saudi Arabia that they will be able to crush him in retaliation. Iraq's first option, of course, may be simply to sit tight and hope it can endure a trade embargo longer than the West can live without Iraqi and Kuwaiti oil. Speaking on the ABC program, Abdul Amir al-Anbari, Iraq's ambassador to the U.N., asserted that an embargo on Iraq could plunge the U.S. into a "depression" and the rest of the world into an economic "crisis." Iraq clearly is trying to woo#e124 back more Arab support#e125 in case the conflict#e128 drags#e129 on, hoping#e130 that its neighbors eventually will help#e131 it survive#e132 a prolonged war#e133 of economic attrition with the West. So Saddam Hussein on Friday#t443 tried#e134 to scare#e136 other Arab leaders into supporting#e138 him by calling#e139 on Arabs to rise#e141 up in a holy war#e142 against leaders who invited#e144 American and other Western soldiers into Saudi Arabia to protect#e146 the oil-rich kingdom. Then yesterday#t444, he tried#e147 to entice#e149 Arab leaders with his proposal#e150 for a diplomatic solution linking#e152 his occupation#e153 of Kuwait with Israel's occupation#e154 of the West Bank. The proposal#e155 also called#e156 for replacing#e157 American and other Western troops in Saudi Arabia with Arab forces. The Bush administration immediately said#e158 it "categorically " rejects#e159 the proposals#e160. And President Bush yesterday#t445, asked#e161 whether he was at least glad Iraq is discussing#e162 negotiations#e163, replied#e164: "I don't see#e165 anything to be pleasing#e168 in there at all." American strategists are calculating, though, that the trade sanctions -- enforced by an effective though perhaps undeclared naval blockade -- will hold tightly enough to convince Iraq that it will lose in the long run by simply standing pat. At that point, rather than go#e180 through the humiliation of backing#e182 out of Kuwait, the Iraqis might well conclude#e183 that they need#e185 to lash#e187 out in some way to shake#e191 things up. In that event, Saddam Hussein appears#e192 to have#e196 three choices. The first would be to launch#e198 the much-feared direct invasion#e200 of Saudi Arabia, hoping#e201 to seize#e203 some Saudi oil fields and improve#e204 his bargaining position. But that option is growing#e206 less and less likely as thousands of American, British, Egyptian, Syrian and Moroccan forces assemble#e207 in and around Saudi Arabia to protect#e209 the kingdom. The Saudis even have in their possession 48 Kuwaiti jet fighters, virtually the entire Kuwaiti air force, which managed#e212 to escape#e214 the Iraqi invasion#e215, Saudi officials said#e216. The Saudi "window of vulnerability... is closing#e446 very fast," Prince Bandar bin Sultan, the Saudi ambassador to Washington, said#e218 over the#t447 weekend#t447. The second possibility would be to start#e220 a fight#e222 with Israel, in hopes that all Arabs would have to move#e227 behind Iraq in a fight#e228 against their common Israeli enemy. In such an event, Saddam Hussein also might calculate#e230, the Saudis would be under pressure to kick#e234 out U.S. troops because of America's close ties with Israel. Iraq could start#e235 hostilities#e699 with Israel either through a direct attack#e237 or by attacking#e239 Jordan. Israel has publicly declared#e240 that it will respond#e241 to an Iraqi attack#e242 on Jordan because it won't allow#e243 Iraq's dangerous army to take#e703 control of Jordan's long border with Israel. Iraq's third attack option would be to start#e249 an undeclared war#e251 on the U.S. and other Western nations through terrorism. Two Middle East terrorists with records of successful attacks against Western targets, Abu Nidal and Abu Abbas, have ties to Baghdad. And even terrorist groups that opposed Iraq in its war with Iran show signs of swinging behind Saddam Hussein now#t1000 that he is in a confrontation with the U.S. And Iraq still has#e262 thousands of Americans and other Westerners under its control in Iraq and Kuwait. They aren't being allowed#e263 to leave#e266 and could become#e267 hostages. If Iraq chooses a simple war of nerves and economic attrition, the Bush administration knows a long stalemate could try the patience of the American public and the West in general, and could open the possibility that moderate Arabs -- even including Saudi Arabia -- might drop out of the effort against Iraq and accept some deal from Saddam Hussein. But U.S. officials have sized#e281 up Saddam Hussein as a man who, despite some recklessness, will back#e282 down if he must. "This is a guy who is impulsive, and therefore capable of big miscalculations," says#e285 one senior administration official involved in managing#e288 the crisis#e289. The official adds#e290, though, that "at the same time, we think#e293 he is someone who is capable#e702 of rational judgments when it comes to power. And when he finds#e299 something is unprofitable, then one can see#e300 certain accommodations#e302." Thus, administration aides will be trying#e303 to calculate#e305 whether Saddam Hussein's proposed diplomatic formula for getting#e307 out of Kuwait represents#e308 the first sign he is searching#e310 for a way out or simply is a public relations stunt#e313. There are disagreements among experts about how much pressure will be needed to make Saddam Hussein decide he's up against the wall and whether simple economic pressure will ever be enough. The biggest worry is that if he decides he needs a way out of his predicament but doesn't see#e3001 a face-saving method, he could lash out in dangerous and unpredictable ways. U.S. officials claim they already see signs Saddam Hussein is getting nervous. In the first days after President Bush announced#e331 the dispatching#e455 of U.S. troops, they note, the Iraqi leader made#e333 several nationwide addresses#e334 indirectly -- having them read#e336 by a television announcer. "That shows#e337 he's nervous about pinpointing#e338 his location, either because he's afraid we'll find#e340 him, or that internal enemies will," says#e342 one U.S. official. The unpredictability of Iraq's leader is a principal reason the U.S. is going to such great lengths to build a mammoth force in and around Saudi Arabia. Pentagon officials say#e349 the goal is to put#e352 40,000 troops in the region by the#t456 end#t456 of#t456 the#t456 month#t456. But the administration isn't putting#e354 any upper limit on how high the force could go#e357 after that, calculating#e359 that it would be a mistake#e361 to underestimate#e363 and an advantage to keep#e365 Saddam Hussein guessing#e366. U.S. commanders in charge of planning#e367 for Middle East crises#e457 have indicated#e368 in the#t1001 past#t1001 that they were capable#e369 of deploying#e370 as many as 300,000 troops. And the U.S. is taking#e372 similar steps to ensure#e374 that its naval force is adequate#e701 to carry#e376 out a blockade#e377 of Iraq and support#e378 a war#e379 if necessary. Over the#t458 weekend#t458, Pentagon officials confirmed#e381 reports that a fourth U.S. aircraft carrier -- the John F. Kennedy -- and its powerful group of support ships could head#e461 for the Middle East within a#t1002 few#t1002 days#t1002. Three other carriers and their escort vessels already are stationed#e383 within striking distance of Iraq or are steaming#e384 toward the area. But unless the military situation changes#e385 drastically, military officials say#e386, the most likely plan will be for the Kennedy to eventually replace#e388 the carrier Dwight D. Eisenhower, which has been on patrol since March#t702 and was scheduled#e391 to return#e393 to port before hostilities erupted#e394 in Kuwait. --- Andy Pasztor contributed to this article.
