Unisys' $648.2 Million 3rd-Period Loss @ Shows Intensified Fight for Turnaround @ ---- @ By Paul B. Carroll @ Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal 10/30/89 WALL STREET JOURNAL (J) UIS EARNINGS (ERN) COMPUTERS AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (CPR)


Unisys Corp.'s announcement#e1 Friday#t209 of a $648.2 million loss#e2 for the#t211 third#t211 quarter#t211 showed that the company is moving#e212 even faster than expected#e5 to take#e7 write-offs#e2065 on its various problems and prepare#e9 for a turnaround#e213 next#t214 year#t214.

At the same time, the sheer size of the loss#e11, coupled with a slowing of orders#e13, made#e14 some securities analysts wonder#e16 just how strong that turnaround will be at the computer maker and defense-electronics concern.

"Unisys is getting#e17 clobbered#e18. Just clobbered," said#e20 Ulric Weil, an analyst at Weil amp Associates who had once been high#e2785 on the company. "The quarter was terrible, and the future looks anything but encouraging."

Unisys, whose revenue inched#e22 up 3.7% in the#t2135 quarter#t2135 to $2.35 billion from $2.27 billion in the#t225 year-earlier#t225 quarter#t225, had#e226 an operating loss#e23 of about $30 million. On top of that, the Blue Bell, Pa., concern took#e24 a $230 million charge#e227 related to the layoffs#e26 of 8,000 employees. That is at the high end of the range of 7,000 to 8,000 employees that Unisys said#e28 a#t228 month#t228 ago#t228 would be laid#e29 off. Unisys said#e31 that should help#e32 it save#e34 $500 million a year in costs, again at the high end of the previously reported range of $400 million to $500 million.

The company also took#e37 a write-off#e38 of $150 million to cover#e40 losses#e229 on some fixed-price defense contracts, as some new managers took#e43 a hard look#e44 at the prospects for that slow-growing business. In addition, Unisys set#e47 up an unspecified reserve -- apparently $60 million to $70 million -- to cover#e49 the minimum amount it will have to pay#e52 the government because of its involvement#e53 in the defense-procurement scandal#e54. Unisys also noted#e56 that it paid#e57 $78.8 million in taxes during the#t235 quarter#t235, even though tax payments#e3000 normally would be minimal in a quarter that produced such a big loss.

The tax payments will leave#e64 Unisys with $225 million in loss carry-forwards that will cut#e67 tax payments#e68 in future#t237 quarters#t237. In addition, Unisys said#e70 it reduced#e2328 computer inventories a further $100 million during the#t239 quarter#t239, leaving#e73 it within $100 million of its goal of a reduction#e241 of $500 million by the#t243 end#t243 of#t243 the#t243 year#t243.

Still, Unisys said#e76 its European business was weak#e244 during the#t246 quarter#t246, a worrisome sign given that the company has relied#e80 on solid results overseas to overcome#e84 weakness in the U.S. over the#t249 past#t249 several#t249 quarters#t249.

The company also reported#e85 slower growth#e250 in another important business: systems that use the Unix operating system. That would be a huge problem#e2410 if it were to continue#e2409, because Unisys is betting#e2405 its business on the assumption that customers want#e2407 to move#e2408 away from using operating systems that run on only one manufacturer's equipment and toward systems -- mainly Unix -- that work on almost anyone's machines.

In addition, Unisys must deal#e105 with its increasingly oppressive debt load. Debt has risen#e107 to around $4 billion, or about 50% of total capitalization. That means Unisys must pay#e110 about $100 million in interest every#t256 quarter#t256, on top of $27 million in dividends on preferred stock.

Jim Unruh, Unisys's president, said#e115 he is approaching#e116 next year with caution. He said#e118 the strength of the world-wide economy is suspect#e1991, and doesn't see much revenue growth in the cards.

He also said#e124 that the price wars flaring#e126 up in parts of the computer industry will continue#e128 through next#t259 year#t259. He said#e129 the move#e1992 toward standard operating systems means customers aren't locked#e1993 into buying from their traditional computer supplier and can force prices down. That, he said#e138, is why Unisys is overhauling#e139 its whole business: It needs#e141 to prepare#e143 for a world in which profit margins will be lower#e1995 than computer companies have been used#e145 to.

"We've approached#e146 this not as a response to a temporary condition in the industry but as a fundamental change the industry is going through," Mr. Unruh said#e152. "The information-systems industry is still going to be a high-growth business#e1997, and we're confident#e1996 that we have#e157 tremendous assets as a company. But we don't minimize#e158 the challenges#e160 of the#t1998 near#t1998 term#t1998."

Securities analysts were even more cautious#e1999, having been burned#e162 repeatedly on Unisys this#t2000 year#t2000. Some had predicted#e163 earnings#e2784 of more than $4 a share for this#t2003 year#t2003, up from last#t2008 year#t2008's fully diluted $3.27 a share on earnings of $680.6 million. But the company said#e165 Friday#t2009 that it had#e166 losses#e2010 of $673.3 million through the#t2012 first#t2012 nine#t2012 months#t2012, compared with earnings#e2015 a#t2013 year#t2013 earlier of $382.2 million, or $2.22 a share fully diluted, as revenue inched#e169 up 1.4% to $7.13 billion from $7.03 billion. And Unisys is expected#e170 to do#e172 little better than break even in the#t2021 fourth#t2021 quarter#t2021.

So Steve Milunovich at First Boston said#e174 he is cutting#e175 his earnings estimate#e2709 for next#t2022 year#t2022 to $2 a share from $3. "I was feeling like I was too high to begin with," he said#e3001.

Mr. Weil of Weil amp Associates said he will remain#e181 at $1 a share for next#t2029 year#t2029 but said#e182 he wonders#e183 whether even that low target is at#e2794 risk. "The break-even point for next#t2034 year#t2034 is much lower#e2032, but is it low#e2795 enough?" he asked#e187.

Reflecting the concern, Unisys stock fell#e189 a further 75 cents to $16.25 in composite trading Friday#t2038 on the New York Stock Exchange.
