Mutual Funds: @ Investors Yank Billions From Junk Funds @ ---- @ By Michael Siconolfi @ Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal 10/27/89 WALL STREET JOURNAL (J) TROW MUTUAL AND MONEY-MARKET FUNDS (FND) BOND MARKET NEWS (BON) NEW YORK


Billions of investors' dollars are pouring#e2 out of the nation's junk-bond mutual funds, undermining#e3 a pillar of support in the already reeling junk market.

Last#t174 week#t174 alone, an eye-popping $1.6 billion flowed#e7 out of the junk funds, or nearly 5% of their total assets, according#e167 to estimates by Dalbar Financial Services Inc., a Boston research firm.

In the#t175 past#t175 two#t175 months#t175 the nation's 88 junk funds have lost#e9 a total of about $6 billion -- more than 15% of assets -- through sales#e168 or transfers#e169 of junk-fund shares, Dalbar says#e11. It made the estimates based on data collected from more than a dozen big junk funds.

Interviews#e16 with three major fund groups -- Fidelity Investments, Vanguard Group Inc. and T. Rowe Price Associates Inc. -- confirm#e17 the trend#e170. Their junk funds combined have had net outflows#e19 totaling nearly $500 million, or about 13% of their junk fund assets, in the#t176 past#t176 two#t176 months#t176.

Some fund managers say#e22 negative publicity has exacerbated#e24 investors' concern about recent#t185 declines#e179 in junk-bond prices. "People have been seeing headline after headline after headline and saying: `I can't take it anymore -- I'm getting out,'" says#e37 Kurt Brouwer of Brouwer amp Janachowski, a San Francisco investment adviser.

The withdrawals#e38 could spell#e39 trouble for the $200 billion junk market. If the heavy outflows#e43 continue#e44, fund managers will face#e46 increasing pressure#e180 to sell#e49 off some of their junk to pay#e51 departing investors in the#t186 weeks#t186 ahead#t186. Such selling#e53 could erode#e54 prices of high-yield junk bonds, already weakened#e57 by a rash of corporate credit problems.

Mutual fund groups haven't lost#e58 control of much of the outgoing money, says#e61 Louis Harvey, Dalbar's president. Mutual fund officials say#e62 that investors have transferred#e63 most of it into their money market accounts, and to a lesser extent, government-bond funds. So the impact#e66 on the $950 billion mutual fund industry as a whole probably will be slight.

But tremors are likely in the junk-bond market, which has helped#e70 to finance#e72 the takeover boom#e73 of recent#t196 years#t196. Mutual funds are the among the largest holders of junk, accounting for more than a quarter of the entire high-yield, high-risk market. The 88 mutual funds investing solely in junk bonds hold assets of about $32 billion. Other funds hold a smattering of junk bonds, too.

The $1.5 billion Fidelity High Income Fund has had a net outflow#e82 of about $150 million in the#t198 past#t198 two#t198 months#t198. About $60 million streamed#e83 out last#t199 week#t199 alone, double the level of the week#t201 following last#t200 month#t200's Campeau Corp. credit squeeze#e189. About 98% of the outflow was transferred#e86 to other Fidelity funds, says#e87 Neal Litvack, a Fidelity vice president, marketing, with most going#e89 into money market funds.

"You get a news item, it hits, you have strong redemptions#e3000 that day and for two days following -- then go back to normal," says#e96 Mr. Litvack. The fund, with a cash cushion of more than 10%, has " met all the redemptions without having to sell one thing," Mr. Litvack says. He adds#e105: "Our fund has had {positive} net sales#e195 every#t2332 month#t2332 for the#t204 last#t204 three#t204 years#t204 -- until this#t205 month#t205."

Vanguard's $1 billion High Yield Bond Portfolio has seen#e109 $161 million flow#e110 out since early#t206 September#t206; $14 million of that seeped#e208 out Friday#t210 Oct.#t210 13#t210 alone. Still, two-thirds of the outflow#e2371 has been steered#e112 into other Vanguard portfolios, says#e113 Brian Mattes, a vice president. The fund now#t211 holds#e116 a cash position of about 15%.

At the $932 million T. Rowe Price High Yield Fund, investors yanked#e117 out about $182 million in the#t213 past#t213 two#t213 months#t213. Those withdrawals#e118, most of which were transferred#e119 to other T. Rowe Price funds, followed little change#e121 in the fund's sales picture this#t214 year#t214 through August#t216. "The#t217 last#t217 two#t217 months#t217 have been the whole ball game#e124," says#e125 Steven Norwitz, a vice president.

Junk-fund holders have barely broken#e127 even this#t1997 year#t1997, as fat interest payments barely managed#e129 to offset declining prices. Through Oct.#t1998 19#t1998, high-yield funds had#e1992 an average 0.85% total return (the price change plus dividends on fund shares), according#e1993 to Lipper Analytical Services Inc. That's even less than the 4.35% total return of the Merrill Lynch High-Yield Index.

Fidelity's junk fund has fallen#e133 2.08% this#t2000 year#t2000 through Oct.#t2001 19#t2001, Lipper says#e134; the Vanguard fund rose#e135 1.84%; and the T. Rowe Price fund edged#e137 up 0.66%.

People who remain#e138 in junk funds now#t2003 could get#e140 hit#e142 again, some analysts and fund specialists say#e143. Many funds in recent#t2004 weeks#t2004 and#t2004 months#t2004 have been selling#e144 their highest-quality junk issues, such as RJR Nabisco, to raise#e146 cash to meet#e149 expected redemptions#e150.

Funds might be forced#e152 to accept#e155 lower prices if they expand#e157 their selling#e1996 to the securities of less-creditworthy borrowers. And then, asset values of the funds could plunge#e160 more than they have so far.

Says Michael Hirsch, chief investment officer of Republic National Bank and manager of the FundTrust Group in New York: "It's a time bomb just waiting to go off."
