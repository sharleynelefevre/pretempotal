Iraq's Saddam Hussein, facing#e5 U.S. and Arab troops at the Saudi border, today#t4 sought#e6 peace on another front by promising#e8 to withdraw#e9 from Iranian territory and release#e10 soldiers captured#e11 during the Iran-Iraq war#e13. Also today#t14, King Hussein of Jordan arrived#e15 in Washington seeking#e16 to mediate#e17 the Persian Gulf crisis#e18. President Bush on Tuesday#t22 said#e19 the United States may extend#e23 its naval quarantine to Jordan's Red Sea port of Aqaba to shut#e27 off Iraq's last unhindered trade route. In another mediation effort, the Soviet Union said#e28 today#t380 it had sent#e29 an envoy to the Middle East on a series of stops#e387 to include Baghdad. Soviet officials also said#e30 Soviet women, children and invalids would be allowed#e33 to leave#e34 Iraq. President Bush today#t37 denounced#e35 Saddam's ``ruinous policies of war,'' and said#e38 the United States is ``striking#e39 a blow for the principle that might does not make right.'' In a speech#e40 delivered#e41 at the Pentagon, Bush seemed#e42 to suggest#e43 that American forces could be in the gulf region for some#t47 time#t47. ``No one should doubt#e50 our staying power or determination,'' he said#e52.

The U.S. military buildup#e53 in Saudi Arabia continued#e54 at fever pace, with Syrian troops now#t56 part of a multinational force camped#e58 out in the desert to guard#e59 the Saudi kingdom from any new thrust#e60 by Iraq. In a letter to President Hashemi Rafsanjani of Iran, read#e61 by a broadcaster over Baghdad radio, Saddam said#e62 he will begin#e63 withdrawing#e64 troops from Iranian territory on Friday#t65 and release#e66 Iranian prisoners of war. Iran said#e67 an Iraqi diplomatic delegation was en route to Tehran to deliver#e69 Saddam's message, which it said#e70 it would review#e73 ``with optimism.'' Saddam appeared#e74 to accept#e75 a border demarcation treaty he had rejected#e77 in peace talks#e78 following the August#t79 1988#t79 cease-fire#e80 of the eight-year#t82 war#e81 with Iran. The move seemed#e83 aimed#e84 at heading#e85 off more trouble with Iran, which had condemned#e87 Iraq's invasion#e88 of Kuwait on Aug.#t89 2#t89 but also criticized#e90 the multinational force dispatched#e91 to Saudi Arabia. Saddam said#e92 he sought#e93 to ``turn#e94 the gulf into a lake of peace free of foreign fleets and forces that harbor#e97 ill intentions against us.'' In other developments: The Pentagon said#e98 that Defense Secretary Dick Cheney is considering#e99 urging#e100 Bush to order#e101 a national callup#e102 of armed forces reserves for active duty because of the drain#e104 on units sending#e106 soldiers abroad. Bush can call#e107 up to 200,000 reservists for up#t719 to#t719 180#t719 days#t719 without seeking#e110 congressional approval. Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Yuri Gremitskikh said#e112 special ambassador Mikhail Sytenko left#e113 Tuesday#t114 for consultations#e116 with the governments of Syria, Jordan, Egypt and other Arab countries.

Sytenko, a former deputy secretary-general of the United Nations, is also expected#e117 to visit#e767 Baghdad, Gremitskikh said#e118 at a regular news briefing#e119 today#t120. The outlook darkened#e121 for about 3,000 Americans caught#e122 in Iraq and Kuwait when Saddam sent#e123 his forces into the small, oil-rich sultanate. The Iraqi ambassador to Greece said#e124 in Athens the Americans and other stranded foreigners could leave#e126 ``as soon as the threats from the United States and its allies are eliminated#e128.'' ABC quoted#e129 an Iraqi Foreign Ministry official in Baghdad as saying#e130 Americans in Iraq are ``restrictees'' who will stay#e131 there until the crisis#e132 ends#e133. The Soviet Foreign Ministry said#e134 Soviet women, children and invalids would be permitted#e136 to leave#e137 Iraq. Spokesman Yuri Gremitskikh said#e138 the first group of 230 evacuees was assembling#e139 in Baghdad today#t140, but evacuation plans were hampered#e144 by desert heat and lack of transportation. Nearly 9,000 Soviets were among the hundreds of thousands of foreigners trapped#e146 in Iraq and Kuwait. Iraq has agreed#e147 to allow#e148 all 880 Soviets in Kuwait to leave#e149, but only by a 1,200-mile road route through Iraq and to the Iraq-Jordan border. The British Foreign Office said#e150 today#t151 conditions in Kuwait appear#e152 to be deteriorating#e153. There have been reports of wholesale looting but food and gasoline were still available, said#e156 a spokesman, who by custom was not identified#e158. Banks remained#e159 closed#e941. The Iraqi ambassador to Venezuela said#e160 on Tuesday#t162 that Iraq would retaliate#e165 against Venezuela and other OPEC oil cartel members if they boost#e166 oil production to fill#e167 the gap created#e168 by blocked supplies from Iraq and Kuwait. With Kuwait now#t170 ``annexed#e171,'' Iraq has control of 20 percent of the world's oil reserves. A steep rise#e173 in world oil prices followed the Kuwait invasion#e175. The U.N. Security Council on Aug.#t176 6#t176 ordered#e177 a global embargo#e178 on trade with Iraq as punishment for seizing#e180 Kuwait. Bush then sent#e181 U.S. troops and planes to Saudi Arabia, saying#e182 Iraqi troops massed#e183 nearby in Kuwait threatened#e184 Saudi Arabia and its vast oil reserves. Twelve Arab League nations voted#e185 for an Arab force to protect#e186 Saudi Arabia, with the vanguard of Syria's contingent arriving#e187 Tuesday#t188, according#e190 to diplomatic sources in Riyadh, the Saudi capital. Egyptian and Moroccan troops are already there#e1078. The predominantly Moslem nation of Bangladesh said#e193 today#t194 its troops would join#e196 multinational forces in Saudi Arabia. The size of the contingent was not disclosed#e198. Turkey and Saudi Arabia in effect shut#e199 down Iraq's major oil outlets through those countries, but according#e200 to Jordanian officials, a smaller line into Jordan remained#e201 operating#e202. Truckloads of goods rolled#e203 into Iraq from Jordan on Tuesday#t204 and Iraqi-bound cargo was unloaded#e206 from ships at the Red Sea port ofAqaba despite the U.N.-ordered sanctions#e207. King Hussein was reportedly carrying#e208 a message to Bush from Iraq's Saddam, with whom the king met#e209 Monday#t210. The monarch will meet#e211 Bush on Thursday#t213 in Kennebunkport, Maine. Crown Prince Hassan, King Hussein's brother and political adviser, was asked#e214 today#t215 about the message the king was said#e216 to be carrying#e217. In an interview#e218 from Jordan on ABC, he declined#e219 to discuss#e220 details, but said#e221: ``I don't think#e223 that his majesty would be traveling#e225 at this#t1192 crucial#t1192 moment#t1192 if the Iraqi leadership did not have a rational approach to the future.''

A CBS News report citing#e230 unidentified Jordanian sources said#e231 that Saddam's message called#e232 for an international conference to be convened#e234 to discuss#e235 an Iraqi withdrawal#e236 from Kuwait. In exchange, the buildup#e238 of U.S. forces in the region would halt#e240. Bush, however, says#e241 he sees#e242 no short-term hope for a diplomatic solution to the gulf crisis#e244 _ at least until economic sanctions force#e245 Saddam to withdraw#e246 his army. Bush held#e247 out the prospect of more aid to Jordan if it cooperates#e249 with the trade embargo. On Tuesday#t252, the United States and Soviet Union conferred#e253 in Washington on putting#e254 an anti-Iraq naval blockade#e255 under a United Nations umbrella. The United States has provided#e256 most of the naval vessels so far to block Iraqi trade, with Britain, West Germany and Australia among the other nations lending#e257 support at sea. The embargo#e258 is meant#e259 to cripple#e260 Iraq by cutting#e261 off its exports of oil and imports of food and military supplies.

Iraq imports#e262 about three-quarters of its foodstuffs. U.S. allies and other U.N. members have objected#e263 that the Security Council embargo resolution did not specifically authorize#e266 such a naval operation#e267. Bush told#e268 a news conference on Tuesday#t269 that the naval barricade now#t271 in force might be extended#e273 to Jordan's Aqaba ``if it is a hole through which commerce flows#e274'' in and out of Iraq. In Saudi Arabia, today#t275 is the eighth#t276 day#t276 of ``Desert Shield,'' the operation#e279 designed to confront#e281 an estimated 200,000 Iraqi soldiers now#t282 in Kuwait. Iraq boasts#e283 an army of 1 million members. At least 50,000 U.S. troops are expected#e284 to be committed#e285 to Desert Shield within weeks#t1460, including Marines, Army air assault forces, paratroopers and infantry. Iraq said#e290 it invaded#e291 Kuwait because of disputes#e292 over oil and money. It accused#e293 Kuwait of deliberately slashing#e294 Iraqi oil revenues by overproducing#e295 oil and driving#e296 down prices, among other charges. Iraq has#e297 17 million residents, and Kuwait about 1.9 million.
