BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP)_ Police seized#e1 a car bomb under construction Sunday#t126 in a town bordering Northern Ireland on the eve of the return#e4 to peace talks#e5 by the IRA-allied Sinn Fein party. Chief Superintendent Al McHugh said#e6 the bomb discovered#e7 in the Irish Republic was destined for an unknown target in Northern Ireland and ``would have caused#e9 massive destruction#e11.'' The discovery#e12 appeared#e13 to be the latest attempt#e15 by extremists opposed to the IRA's 8-month-old#t127 truce#e147 to undermine#e19 the peace process, set#e21 to resume#e23 Monday#t128 in Belfast. Extremists have bombed#e24 two predominantly pro-British Protestant towns and fired mortar shells at a police station since Sinn Fein was expelled#e26 from peace talks on Feb.#t129 20#t129 in punishment#e29 for two killings#e30 blamed on the Irish Republican Army. Police found#e32 more than 1,300 pounds (600 kgs) of fertilizer-based explosives Sunday#t130 in a shed in Dundalk, 50 miles (80 kms) south of Belfast. They arrested#e33 two men in connection with the bomb factory, which also contained circuitry, detonating cord and the Mitsubishi truck that would have carried#e36 the bomb. The British and Irish governments, which cosponsor#e38 the multi-party talks that are supposed#e40 to conclude#e42 by May#t131, invited#e43 Sinn Fein to rejoin#e45 two#t2023 weeks#t2023 ago#t2023. But Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams kept#e46 his party out pending meetings#e49 with British Prime Minister Tony Blair 10#t132 days#t132 ago#t132 and President Clinton last#t134 week#t134. ``We were unjustly pushed#e50 out of the talks#e51 in February#t135 but we are back,'' Adams said#e52 Sunday#t136. He said#e53 the north's substantial Catholic minority demanded#e54 a settlement that would promote#e55 Northern Ireland's eventual unification#e57 with the Irish Republic. ``Nationalists in the north are not a minority in someone else's country. We are Irish citizens, living#e59 in our own country,'' Adams said#e60, adding#e61: ``Nationalists want#e62 to move#e64 towards Irish unity and see this process as a bridge in that direction.'' But the north's pro-British Protestant majority is bitterly opposed#e67 to uniting#e68 Ireland and instead wants#e69 a strong government for Northern Ireland, which has been ruled#e70 directly by London since 1972#t137. Northern Ireland's biggest Protestant party, the Ulster Unionists, is threatening#e72 to push#e74 for Sinn Fein's expulsion#e75 once again. They say#e76 IRA commanders are responsible#e152 for the recent bomb attacks#e78. Also Sunday#t138, more than 2,000 Catholic protesters rallied#e79 in Portadown against the annual parades by the Orange Order, Northern Ireland's dominant Protestant fraternal group. Confrontations#e80 among Catholic protesters, Protestant marchers and the police have provoked#e81 widespread violence#e82 in Northern Ireland for the#t154 past#t154 three#t154 summers#t154. The crucible is Portadown, 30 miles (50 kms) southwest of Belfast, where Orangemen march each#t150 July#t150 from their rural church back downtown _ through the town's main Catholic area. Protesters from several Catholic communities crowded#e83 into Portadown's Catholic Garvaghy Road to hear#e85 speakers demand#e86 negotiations#e87 with Orange Order leaders, and pledge#e156 to participate#e89 in each others' road-blocking protests#e90 this#t144 summer#t144. ``Small nationalist communities are not going to be left#e94 on their own this#t145 summer#t145,'' said#e95 Gerard Rice, a former IRA prisoner who leads anti-Orange protests in a Catholic neighborhood of south Belfast. Riot police in armored cars, shields and helmets prevented#e97 a few hundred Protestants, many waving#e98 British and Ulster flags, from interfering#e100 with the Catholics as they marched#e101 within Portadown's few Catholic streets. Earlier#t146 Sunday#t146, police and militant Protestants clashed#e102 in a religiously polarized part of north Belfast. Police said#e104 an unmarked police car was hit#e105 with gasoline bombs from the Protestant side. Riot police responded#e107 with a volley of plastic bullets that scattered#e110 a 50-strong mob. An elderly Catholic man was hospitalized#e111 from cuts after a Protestant gasoline bomb landed#e115 in his back yard. Police arrested#e116 six Protestants on suspicion of rioting. (sp/eml)
