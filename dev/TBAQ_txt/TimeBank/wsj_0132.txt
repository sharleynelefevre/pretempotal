International Brief -- N.V. DSM: @ Third-Period Net Rose 63% @ Because of Lower Charges 11/02/89 WALL STREET JOURNAL (J) EUROP N.DSM EARNINGS (ERN)


N.V. DSM said#e1 net income in the#t36 third#t36 quarter#t36 jumped#e2 63% as the company had#e73 substantially lower extraordinary charges#e3 to account#e5 for a restructuring program.

The Dutch chemical group said#e6 net income gained#e7 to 235 million guilders ($113.2 million), or 6.70 guilders a share, from 144 million guilders, or 4.10 guilders a share, a#t43 year#t43 ago#t43.

The 32% state-owned DSM had#e8 eight million guilders of extraordinary charges#e9 in the#t45 latest#t45 quarter#t45, mainly to reflect#e10 one-time losses#e47 in connection with the disposal#e12 of some operations. The charges were offset#e15 in part by a gain#e48 from the sale#e17 of the company's construction division.

Last#t49 year#t49, DSM had#e19 71 million guilders of extraordinary charges#e20 for the restructuring program and other transactions.

The earnings growth#e51 also was fueled#e22 by the company's ability to cut#e24 net financing spending by half to around 15 million guilders. Also, substantially lower Dutch corporate tax rates helped#e26 the company keep#e27 its tax outlay flat relative to earnings growth, the company added#e29.

Sales, however, were little changed#e31 at 2.46 billion guilders, compared with 2.42 billion guilders.
