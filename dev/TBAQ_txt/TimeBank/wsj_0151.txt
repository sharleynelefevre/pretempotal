Business Brief -- Intelogic Trace Inc.: @ Shareholder Sells 18% Stake @ In $9.9 Million Buy-Back 11/02/89 WALL STREET JOURNAL (J) IT DPC BUYBACKS, REDEMPTIONS, SWAP OFFERS (BBK)


Intelogic Trace Inc., San Antonio, Texas, said#e1 it bought#e2 2.7 million shares, or about 18%, of its common stock from an unaffiliated shareholder for $3.625 a share, or $9.9 million.

The move boosts#e4 Intelogic Chairman Asher Edelman's stake to 20% from 16.2% and may help#e6 prevent#e8 Martin Ackerman from making#e10 a run#e11 at the computer-services concern. Mr. Ackerman already is seeking#e13 to oust#e15 Mr. Edelman as chairman of Datapoint Corp., an Intelogic affiliate.

The action#e16 followed#e17 by one#t60 day#t60 an Intelogic announcement#e57 that it will retain#e18 an investment banker to explore#e20 alternatives "to maximize#e22 shareholder value," including the possible sale#e23 of the company.

In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday#t58, Intelogic shares rose#e24 37.5 cents to close#e182 at $2.75.

Mr. Edelman declined#e27 to specify#e29 what prompted#e30 the recent moves#e31, saying#e32 they are meant#e33 only to benefit#e34 shareholders when "the company is on#e183 a roll." He added#e61, "This has#e39 nothing to do with Marty Ackerman and it is not designed#e41, particularly, to take#e43 the company private."

But Mr. Ackerman said#e44 the buy-back#e64, and the above-market price paid#e45, prove#e46 that Mr. Edelman is running#e47 scared.
