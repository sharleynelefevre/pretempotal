JERUSALEM (AP)_ Top Israeli officials sent#e1 strong new signals Sunday#t123 that Israel wants#e3 to withdraw#e5 from southern Lebanon, where a costly war#e6 of attrition has been steadily claiming#e7 soldiers' lives. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told#e8 his Cabinet on Sunday#t125 that Israel was willing#e1990 to withdraw#e10 from southern Lebanon provided Israel's northern frontier could be secured#e12. ``If the Lebanese government will cooperate#e14 with us in making#e16 appropriate security arrangements in south Lebanon, we will be happy to get#e18 out of Lebanon in the framework of implementation of U.N. Resolution 425,'' Netanyahu told#e20 his ministers. That 1978#t128 resolution calls#e22 for Israel's unconditional withdrawal#e23 from the self-declared security zone it occupies#e24 in south Lebanon, and for the deployment#e25 of the Lebanese army and U.N. forces to ensure#e27 security along the Lebanese-Israeli border. On Friday#t127, Netanyahu said#e29 he had#e30 ``no qualms'' about implementing#e32 the U.N. resolution, as long as Israel had#e33 ``the necessary security safeguards.'' Cabinet minister Michael Eitan said#e35 Sunday#t129 that Netanyahu's remarks#e36 marked#e37 a substantive change#e38 in Israel's position. ``We will defend#e39 our north from the international border,'' said#e40 Eitan, the science minister. ``No one wants#e41 to stay#e43 in Lebanon; thus we think#e44 it better to withdraw#e46.'' Uri Lubrani, Israel's top official for Lebanon affairs, also suggested#e47 Israel was willing#e132 to modify#e49 its political goals in Lebanon. ``This is a new thing...it means that we are willing#e133 to talk#e54 today#t134 _ full stop _ about security,'' Lubrani told#e57 Israel's Channel One. ``We have gotten#e58 off the issue of peace, off the issue of normalization.'' As the death toll in Lebanon has mounted#e60, the Israeli government has been faced#e61 with a growing grassroots movement#e62 calling#e63 for Israel's unilateral withdrawal#e64 from Lebanon. Since 1985#t1979 _ when the Israelis created#e66 a security buffer zone southern Lebanon _ nearly 200 Israeli soldiers have been killed#e67 fighting#e68 Hezbollah and other guerrillas. Last#t1980 week#t1980, Hezbollah fighters killed#e69 three Israeli soldiers and seriously wounded#e70 six others. The Israelis suffered#e71 a record 39 deaths in southern Lebanon last#t1981 year#t1981. In addition, 73 soldiers were killed#e75 en route to Lebanon when two military helicopters crashed#e77 last#t1982 February#t1982. The Maariv newspaper said#e78 Sunday#t1983 that Netanyahu's comments last#t1985 week#t1985 were in response to signals from Syria that it wants#e81 to renew#e83 the long-stalled peace talks#e84 between the two countries. The newspaper, quoting#e85 ``secret reports,'' said#e87 Syria had indicated#e88 its interest in resuming#e90 talks#e91 in remarks#e92 made#e94 last#t1986 week#t1986 by the Syrian ambassador to Washington, Walid Mualem, in a lecture#e95 to a closed forum in Baltimore. Two top aides to Netanyahu, political adviser Uzi Arad and Cabinet Secretary Danny Naveh, left#e97 for Europe on Sunday#t1987, apparently to investigate#e98 the Syrian issue, the newspaper said#e99. Israel-Syrian talks#e100 have been cut#e101 off for nearly#t1988 two#t1988 years#t1988. Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai was the first senior Israeli official to refer#e102 to U.N. resolution 425 in a speech#e103 six#t1989 weeks#t1989 ago#t1989, saying#e105 at the#t1993 time#t1993 he was willing#e1994 to withdraw#e109 troops in exchange for guarantees that Israel would not be attacked#e113.
