Orkem S.A., a French state-controlled chemical manufacturer, is making#e1 a friendly bid#e2 of 470 pence ($7.43) a share for the 59.2% of U.K. specialty chemical group Coates Brothers PLC which it doesn't already own#e3, the two sides said#e5.

The offer, which values the whole of Coates at #301 million, has already been accepted#e8 by Coates executives and other shareholders owning 12.4% of the company. The acceptances give#e11 Orkem a controlling 53.2% stake in the company.

Orkem and Coates said#e12 last#t50 Wednesday#t50 that the two were considering#e13 a merger#e14, through Orkem's British subsidiary, Orkem Coatings U.K. Ltd.

Orkem, France's third-largest chemical group, said#e15 it would fund#e16 the acquisition#e18 through internal resources. The takeover#e19 would be followed by a restructuring#e45 of Orkem's U.K. unit, including the addition#e22 of related Orkem businesses and possibly further acquisitions#e24. Orkem said#e25 it eventually would seek#e26 to make#e29 a public share offering in its U.K. business.
