Thursday's Markets: @ Earnings @ Data Cause @ Stock Fall @ --- @ Industrials Sink 39.55; @ Bonds Slip, but Dollar @ Soars Against Pound @ ---- @ By Douglas R.

Some lousy earnings reports whacked#e2 the stock market, but bond prices fell#e89 only slightly and the dollar rose#e6 a little against most major currencies.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbled#e8 39.55 points, to 2613.73, in active trading. Long-term Treasury bonds ended#e11 slightly higher. The dollar rose#e13 modestly against the mark and the yen, but soared#e15 against the pound following the resignation#e17 of Britain's chancellor of the Exchequer, Nigel Lawson.

Analysts have complained#e18 that third-quarter#t176 corporate earnings haven't been very good#e135, but the effect hit#e20 home particularly hard yesterday#t95. Compaq Computer nose-dived#e21 $8.625 a share, to $100, and pulled#e22 other technology issues lower after reporting#e24 lower-than-expected earnings after the stock market closed#e27 Wednesday#t99. Later#t100 yesterday#t100 the nation's major auto makers added#e28 to the gloom when they each reported#e30 their core auto operations were net losers#e101 in the#t103 third#t103 quarter#t103.

The less-than-robust third-quarter#t104 results#e32 came amid renewed concern about the volatility of stock prices and the role of computer-aided program trading. Taken together, the worries prompted#e37 a broad sell-off#e109 of stocks. The number of stocks on the New York Stock Exchange that fell#e38 in price yesterday#t110 exceeded 1,000, a key measure of underlying sentiment among technical analysts.

Although the government said#e43 the economy grew#e44 an estimated 2.5% in the#t112 third#t112 quarter#t112, in line with expectations, analysts are increasingly predicting#e47 much more sluggish growth#e114 -- and therefore more corporate earnings disappointments#e48 -- for the#t116 fourth#t116 quarter#t116.

"There are a lot more downward revisions#e49 of earnings forecasts than upward revisions#e51," said#e52 Abby Joseph Cohen, a market strategist at Drexel Burnham Lambert. "People are questioning#e53 corporate profits as a pillar of support for the equity market."

The bond market was unmoved#e117 by the economic statistics. While bond investors would have preferred#e118 growth#e119 to be#e134 a little slower, they were cheered#e60 by inflation measures in the data that showed prices rising#e63 at a modest annual rate of 2.9%. That is another small encouragement#e65 for the Federal Reserve to lower#e120 interest rates in coming#t121 weeks#t121, they reasoned#e68.

In major market activity#e123: Stock prices fell#e70 sharply in active trading. Volume on the New York Stock Exchange totaled#e73 175.2 million shares. Declining issues on the Big Board outstripped#e75 gainers 1,141 to 406.

Bond prices were barely higher#e124. The Treasury's benchmark 30-year#t500 rose#e76 fractionally. Yield on the issue was 7.88%.

The dollar rose#e80 modestly against most major currencies. In late New York trading the dollar was at 1.8400 marks and 142.10 yen compared with 1.8353 marks and 141.52 yen Wednesday#t130. The dollar soared#e85 against the pound, which was at $1.5765 compared with $1.6145 Wednesday#t131.
