Front SUNUNU BATTLES TO KEEP HIS JOB


One of President Bush's sons has informed#e64 White House Chief of Staff John Sununu that he has lost#e65 much of his support among Republicans, prompting#e68 an intense effort by Sununu to hold#e83 on to his job by demonstrating#e84 his GOP backing, White House and Republican sources said#e69 Monday#t70. Sununu was told#e85 Wednesday#t73 by Bush's son, George, that he had alienated#e75 members of the Cabinet, the White House staff and the Republican political community, creating#e76 a situation that puts his effectiveness in significant doubt, the sources said#e77. The message to the chief of staff was meant to be taken as a suggestion that Sununu offer to resign, one highly placed source said#e8. Instead, Sununu sought#e9 to prove#e11 to the president that his supporters outnumber#e12 his critics and that he should remain#e13 in his post. One senior official Monday#t78 described#e15 the White House as "a collection of small groups of aides holding#e16 their breaths, "waiting#e17 to see#e19 whether Sununu survives#e20. One GOP source, reporting#e21 on a call#e80 from the chief of staff to a Republican leader, said#e24 Sununu lamented#e25 that "the noose is tightening#e26 around my neck, and I need#e28 your help#e29 ."; Another highly placed source said#e30 the president's son met#e31 with Sununu last#t81 week#t81 after holding#e33 a series of conversations#e35 about the structure of the White House staff and of the campaign with other Bush loyalists and GOP activists. The source said#e37 the younger Bush "sketched#e38 out for Sununu" problems the president is encountering#e39 because of the chief of staff's tenure. "He was told#e40 ... the handwriting was on#e317 the wall," the source said#e43 Monday#t87. That, the source said#e44, was when Sununu started#e46 calling#e47 congressional Republicans and asking#e48 them to tell#e50 Bush that the conservative wing of the party, in particular, would object#e53 if he were fired#e316. Officials said#e55 the president himself met#e56 with Sununu Sunday#t88. A source said#e57 the outcome of that session#e59 was unclear.
