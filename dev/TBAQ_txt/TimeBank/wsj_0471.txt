10/31/89 
WALL STREET JOURNAL (J) DPC TENDER OFFERS, MERGERS, ACQUISITIONS (TNM) COMPUTERS AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (CPR)


Dataproducts Inc. said#e1 it filed#e2 a lawsuit#e3 in Delaware Chancery Court to block#e5 a tender offer#e36 by DPC Acquisition Partners, alleging#e7 that the hostile offer#e8 violates#e9 a standstill agreement#e10 between the two concerns.

DPC, an investor group led#e12 by New York-based Crescott Investment Associates, had itself filed#e14 a suit#e15 in state court in Los Angeles seeking#e17 to nullify#e19 the agreement#e20. Earlier#t39 this#t39 year#t39, Dataproducts had rejected#e21 a $15 a share offer#e22 from DPC, saying#e23 it wasn't adequately financed#e24. DPC last#t40 week#t40 launched#e26 a new, $10-a-share offer#e27 for the Woodland Hills, Calif.-based computer printer maker.

DPC said#e28 it couldn't comment#e29 on the suit.
