ROGERS COMMUNICATIONS Inc. said#e1 it plans#e2 to raise#e4 175 million to 180 million Canadian dollars (US$148.9 million to $153.3 million) through a private placement#e5 of perpetual preferred shares. Perpetual preferred shares aren't retractable by the holders, the company said#e7. Rogers said#e8 the shares will be convertible#e27 into Class B shares, but that the company has#e29 the option to redeem#e13 the shares before a conversion#e14 takes#e16 place. A spokesman for the Toronto cable television and telecommunications concern said#e17 the coupon rate hasn't yet been fixed#e18, but will probably be set#e20 at around 8%. He declined#e21 to discuss#e23 other terms of the issue.
