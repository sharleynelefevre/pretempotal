WASHINGTON -- With the ground battle#e433 to liberate#e435 Kuwait proceeding#e436 with surprising speed and success, Bush administration officials are optimistic the Persian Gulf war#e438 can begin#e439 winding#e441 down in a matter of days.
The enormous ground offensive#e524 by U.S. Marines and Army troops, at least during its first 24 hours, met#e442 only sporadic Iraqi resistance#e443 as it quickly penetrated#e444 deep into Kuwait and parts of Iraq, military officials said#e446.
According to press pool reports#e447, U.S. Marines are already on#e534 the outskirts of Kuwait City.


"So far, the offensive#e449 is progressing with dramatic success," said#e4 a buoyant Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf, commander of U.S. forces. Similarly, while cautioning about the uncertainty of early battle reports, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said#e8 late#t451 yesterday#t451 that "the operation#e9 has been very successful." Amid reports that thousands of Iraqi soldiers had surrendered#e11, administration aides were also upbeat in private, with one even talking#e12 of victory within a week. But even continued military success carries#e16 political and diplomatic risks for President Bush and the U.S. The allied rejection#e18 of the last-minute Soviet-led diplomatic effort#e19 to avoid#e21 the ground war#e22 enabled#e23 Mr. Bush to seize#e25 the initiative from an Iraq seemingly bent on dictating#e452 peace terms. But it has offended#e28 some, especially in Arab countries, who now believe#e29 that Mr. Bush's real objectives are the demise#e453 of Saddam Hussein and the destruction#e30 of the Iraqi military, not just the liberation#e31 of Kuwait. "Why have a war#e32?" asked#e33 Abdul Latif Shekar, a customs officer in Egypt, a country participating#e34 in the attack#e35 on Iraqi troops. "I think#e37 the Gorbachev plan was a good one. Iraq was ready to withdraw#e39." Now, he says#e40, "it looks#e41 like the West just wants#e42 to destroy#e44 Iraq." Despite the early indications of success, the allied forces could still suffer#e47 greater casualties and become#e526 bogged#e456 down militarily, especially when they encounter#e52 the tough Republican Guard, which is entrenched#e53 along the Iraq-Kuwait border. If so, and if it appears#e55 that the American goal actually is to destroy#e58 the Iraqi regime even at the cost of badly hurting Iraqi society, "the lingering cost of that could be high," worries#e458 former national security adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski. But, he notes#e62, "If everything crumbles#e459 totally, that won't be such a problem." American officials staunchly disavow#e64 any interest in driving#e66 through Iraq toward Baghdad, either in pursuit#e67 of Saddam Hussein himself or to set#e69 up some American-controlled government inside Iraq. The Americans say#e70 their battle plans call#e71 for operating#e72 against forces inside Iraq as far north as the city of Basra, about 30 miles north of Kuwait, but say there isn't any plan to drive#e76 beyond that. Indeed, French President Francois Mitterrand said#e77 yesterday#t463 that some allied forces are crossing#e78 Iraqi territory as part of a "pincer" movement to trap#e466 the soldiers occupying Kuwait, but insisted#e81, "The purpose isn't to invade#e82 Iraqi territory, that's not the aim, that isn't the mandate." Nevertheless, American officials over the#t472 weekend#t472 became#e84 more open#e473 in declaring#e86 that by destroying#e87 Saddam Hussein's military machine they hope#e88 to destroy#e90 his regime -- a goal likely to be supported#e93 by most Americans. In a pre-attack message, Lt. Gen. Walter Boomer, the top Marine in the Persian Gulf, told#e95 U.S. Marines that their goal is to " restore#e98 {Kuwait} to its citizens." He went#e99 on to add#e102 that "in so doing#e104 you not only return#e105 a nation to its people, but you will destroy#e106 the war machine of a ruthless dictator." Secretary of State James Baker said#e107 on ABC-TV's "This Week With David Brinkley" that the series of United Nations resolutions condemning#e478 Iraq's invasion#e110 of Kuwait "imply#e111 that the restoration#e112 of peace and stability in the Gulf would be a heck of a lot easier if he and that leadership were not in power in Iraq." Of course, it is still far too early to assume#e120 that the military situation#e482 on the ground will stay#e122 as smooth for allied forces as it appears#e124 to have been so far. Iraq still has#e127 the potential to cause#e129 significant problems by using#e130 forces and weapons that don't yet seem#e132 fully engaged#e133. For one thing, Iraq still apparently hasn't unleashed#e135 its stockpile of chemical weapons. Gen. Schwarzkopf said#e138 that some early reports that chemical weapons were used#e141 against allied troops turned#e142 out to be "bogus." Iraq is believed#e144 to have#e146 the ability to deliver#e148 chemical weapons in artillery shells or, perhaps, atop Soviet-made Frog7 missiles. Perhaps more important, it appears#e150 that allied troops haven't yet fully engaged#e151 Iraq's vaunted Republican Guard, which has been sitting#e487 just north of the Iraq-Kuwait border and is considered#e154 the most potent element in the Iraqi defense. It remains#e157 to be seen#e159 how much damage#e160 the allied air campaign#e161 was able to inflict#e163 on the Guard, and whether President Hussein will commit#e164 his most valued troops to a fight-to-the-death finish. Certainly Saddam Hussein continues#e166 to implore#e168 his country to fight#e169 on. "Fight#e170 them," he urged#e171 Iraqis in a radio address#e173. "All Iraqis, fight#e174 them with all the power you have#e175, and all struggle#e176 for everything." American war planners have long assumed#e180 that the early stage of the ground attack#e181, in which American forces would use#e182 their speed to sweep#e185 around Iraqi defenses and their strength to punch#e188 through the relatively weak Iraqi front line, would be the easiest part. Despite these early successes, the mere fact that a ground campaign#e194 has begun#e195 almost guarantees#e196 that the Bush administration will face#e527 fresh problems growing#e197 out of the military situation#e491. There are likely to be additional American prisoners of war taken, and there are signs that President Hussein is taking#e202 Kuwaiti hostages. U.S. and Kuwaiti officials say#e203 there are reports that large numbers of civilians from Kuwait City are being rounded#e492 up and held#e207 by Iraqi troops, apparently either for use#e208 as human shields or for use#e209 later in bargaining#e210 once the war#e211 is over. President Bush's political argument for going#e213 to a ground war#e214 has been strengthened#e215 by the growing stream of reports of wanton Iraqi destruction#e217 inside Kuwait. U.S. officials say#e218 that hundreds of Kuwaiti oil wells now may have been set#e219 afire. And Robert Gates, Mr. Bush's deputy national security adviser, asserted#e221 in an interview#e222 on the Cable News Network that Iraqi troops have set#e224 fire to "large sections" of Kuwait City. Mr. Bush and his aides were leaning#e227 toward a military conclusion#e528 of the crisis#e228 even before the latest reports of Iraqi atrocities#e231 in Kuwait came#e232 to light. The president and his top aides tentatively decided#e235 on Feb.#t494 11#t494 that a ground war#e236 would be necessary#e538. The decision#e238 was made#e239 after Defense Secretary Dick Cheney and Gen. Colin Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, returned#e240 from a visit#e241 with military commanders in Saudi Arabia, administration officials say#e243. Then, a#t496 week#t496 or#t496 so#t496 ago#t496, Gen. Schwarzkopf secretly picked#e244 Saturday#t498 night#t498 as the optimal time to start#e247 the offensive#e248. The date was unaffected#e500 by the last-ditch Soviet peace initiative#e249. The real problem with the Soviet proposals, U.S. officials now say#e251, was that they all would have required#e252 lifting#e254 economic sanctions#e255 against Iraq. The Bush administration considers#e256 the sanctions#e257 essential to keeping#e258 Saddam Hussein under control should he survive#e259 the war#e260. Mr. Bush forestalled#e261 further diplomatic maneuvering#e504 by issuing#e262 an ultimatum on behalf of the allies demanding#e266 that Iraq withdraw#e267 within a#t505 week#t505, starting#e268 at noon#t507 Saturday#t507. Administration aides said#e269 that the idea of the ultimatum was Gen. Powell's. He argued#e271 setting#e272 an explicit deadline for Saddam Hussein to break#e274 would, when it was broken#e276, give#e277 the U.S. military a clear green light to proceed#e279. In setting#e280 out his final challenge to Saddam Hussein, Mr. Bush continued#e282 the intensive personal diplomacy#e283 he began#e284 after the invasion#e285 last#t508 August#t508. After cabling#e287 world leaders about his intention to give#e289 Saddam Hussein a final deadline to exit#e290 Kuwait, he offered#e291 him a#t518 week#t518 to withdraw#e293 fully, instead of the#t519 four#t519 days#t519 he originally considered#e294, because of objections#e295 from some European partners that four days seemed#e296 punitive and unrealistic. And when he and President Gorbachev spoke#e298 about the decision#e299 in a talk#e511 lasting nearly#t520 an#t520 hour#t520, the President took#e300 pains to listen#e303 to what his counterpart had to say#e306, although he already had decided#e307 that the Soviet alternative to the allied deadline was unacceptable#e539. Finally, when Iraq failed#e309 to respond#e311 to the U.S. ultimatum, Mr. Bush let#e312 the ground offensive#e513 begin#e313 as previously planned#e314 Saturday#t514 night#t514. The attack#e315 was lightning quick, as allied forces punched#e317 through tall sand berms on the border and pushed#e318 forward into Iraq and Kuwait. U.S. Marines were said#e319 to have breached#e321 troublesome mine fields along the Iraqi lines but Pentagon officials said#e323 no amphibious assault#e324 on Kuwait's beaches had begun#e325. Long columns of Iraqi prisoners of war could be seen#e327 trudging#e329 through the desert toward the allied rear. U.S. commanders said#e331 5,500 Iraqi prisoners were taken#e332 in the#t21 first#t21 hours#t21 of the ground war#e334, though some military officials later said#e335 the total may have climbed#e336 above 8,000. The U.S. hopes#e338 its troops will drive#e339 Iraqi forces out of Kuwait quickly, leaving#e340 much of Iraq's offensive military equipment destroyed#e341 or abandoned#e342 in Kuwait. It expects#e343 that tens of thousands of Iraqi soldiers will surrender#e344 to the U.S. and its allies over the#t517 next#t517 few#t517 days#t517. If the allies succeed#e345, Saddam Hussein will have plunged#e346 his country first into a fruitless eight-year#t521 war#e347 against Iran and then into a humiliating war#e349 against the U.S. and the allies to defend#e352 his conquest#e353 of Kuwait, leaving#e354 much of his country's military establishment and modern infrastructure in ruins. Meanwhile, the U.S. hopes#e356, economic sanctions#e357 and an international arms embargo#e518 will remain#e358 in effect until Iraq pays#e359 war reparations to Kuwait to cover#e362 war damages. That would undermine#e363 any chances of rebuilding#e365 either Iraq or its armed forces in short order as long as Saddam Hussein remains#e368 in power. The American hope is that someone from within Iraq, perhaps from the army's professional ranks, will step forward and push Saddam Hussein aside so that the country can begin recovering from the disaster. Outside analysts think#e369 Saddam Hussein's position is indeed precarious. "I think frankly Saddam is finished#e378, no matter what happens#e380," says#e381 Christine Helms, a Middle East scholar who has written#e382 extensively about Iraq. "These guys simply don't retire#e383 to condos over the Euphrates." Despite the lack of any obvious successors, the Iraqi leader's internal power base appeared#e385 to be narrowing#e387 even before the war#e388 began#e390. Some analysts say#e391 he appeared#e392 to be relying#e394 on a smaller and smaller circle of close advisers and relatives. If that's true, the narrowing of his support would make#e398 it easier for someone to push#e401 him aside from within. Yet, paradoxically, the perception that the U.S. wants#e402 to destroy#e404 Iraq may increase#e405 Saddam Hussein's support within the Iraqi military. And the U.S. now will face#e523 sharper questions in the Arab world since it didn't back#e409 the peace proposals worked out in Moscow. "We looked#e413 to the United States, we expected#e414 you to have#e416 the moral edge," says#e417 Nasser Tahboub, a Jerusalem-born Jordanian who has#e418 an American wife and a doctorate in political science from Duke University. "Now we see#e420 that edge eroded#e421. For me, it is a great tragedy#e422. For the first time in history, the U.S. has gone#e424 to war#e425 with an Arab and Muslim nation, and we know#e426 a peaceful solution was in reach." --- Geraldine Brooks in Amman, Jordan, and Craig Forman in Cairo, Egypt, contributed to this article.
