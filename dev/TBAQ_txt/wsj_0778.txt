Law: @ U.S. Threats to Seize Fees @ Scare Lawyers From Cases @ ---- @ By Laurie P. Cohen @ Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal 10/27/89 WALL STREET JOURNAL (J) CRZYQ LAW AND LEGAL AFFAIRS (LAW) BANKRUPTCIES (BCY) JUSTICE DEPARTMENT (JUS) SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (SEC)


The government is sharpening#e1 its newest weapon against white-collar defendants: the power to prevent#e4 them from paying#e6 their legal bills. And defense lawyers are warning#e8 that they won't stick#e9 around if they don't get paid#e14.

The issue has come to a boil in Newark, N.J., where federal prosecutors have warned#e16 lawyers for Eddie Antar that if the founder and former chairman of Crazy Eddie Inc. is indicted#e18, the government may move#e19 to seize#e22 the money that Mr. Antar is using#e24 to pay#e26 legal fees.

The warning#e27 by the U.S. attorney's office follows two decisions#e29 by the U.S. Supreme Court last#t233 June#t233. In those cases, the high court ruled#e31 that federal law gives#e33 prosecutors broad authority to seize#e35 assets of people accused of racketeering and drug-related crimes, including fees paid to lawyers before an indictment.

If the government succeeds#e42 in seizing#e44 Mr. Antar's assets, he could be left#e45 without top-flight legal representation, because his attorneys are likely to quit#e48, according#e206 to individuals familiar with the case. A seizure#e50 also would make#e51 the case the largest -- and one of the first -- in which lawyers' fees have been confiscated in a prosecution unrelated to drugs.

"The people who suffer in the short run are defendants, but the people who suffer in the long run are all of the people, because there won't be a vigorous private bar to defend the Bill of Rights," says#e66 Gerald Lefcourt, a criminal defense attorney who says#e67 he has turned#e68 down a number of cases to avoid#e71 possible fee seizures#e72.

Mr. Antar is being investigated#e73 by a federal grand jury in Newark, where prosecutors have told#e74 him that they may soon#t234 seek#e75 an indictment on racketeering and securities fraud charges. Under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations law, or RICO, the government has#e84 the authority to seek#e86 to freeze#e88 or seize#e89 a defendant's assets before trial#e90.

According#e208 to individuals familiar with Mr. Antar's case, prosecutors issued#e93 their warning this#t235 week#t235 after one of Mr. Antar's attorneys asked#e95 whether legal fees might be subject#e210 to seizure#e98. In a letter, prosecutors told#e100 Mr. Antar's lawyers that because of the recent#t236 Supreme Court rulings#e214, they could expect#e101 that any fees collected from Mr. Antar may be seized#e104. Prosecutors have told#e106 Mr. Antar's attorneys that they believe#e107 Mr. Antar's allegedly ill-gotten gains are so great that any money he has used to pay attorneys derives#e112 from illegal activities#e113. Therefore, they said#e114, the money can be taken#e116 from the lawyers even after they are paid#e118.

Justin Feldman and Jack Arseneault, attorneys for Mr. Antar, both declined#e119 to comment#e121 on the matter.

In Newark, U.S. Attorney Samuel A. Alito said#e123, "I don't think#e124 there's any legal reason to limit#e216 forfeiture of attorney's fees to drug cases." Mr. Alito said#e128 his office "just responded#e129 to an attorney's question about whether we would go#e131 after attorney's fees, and that is different from actually doing it, although we reserve#e218 that right."

Mr. Antar was charged#e137 last#t237 month#t237 in a civil suit filed#e140 in federal court in Newark by the Securities and Exchange Commission. In that suit, the SEC accused#e143 Mr. Antar of engaging#e144 in a "massive financial fraud#e145" to overstate#e147 the earnings of Crazy Eddie, Edison, N.J., over a#t238 three-year#t238 period#t238. Through his lawyers, Mr. Antar has denied#e148 allegations#e149 in the SEC suit and in civil suits previously filed#e154 by shareholders against Mr. Antar and others.

The SEC has alleged#e155 that Mr. Antar aimed#e156 to pump#e158 up the company's stock price through false financial statements in order to sell#e164 his stake and reap#e166 huge profits. Mr. Antar, the SEC said#e167, made#e168 more than $60 million from the sale#e169 of his shares between 1985#t240 and 1987#t241.

The Justice Department has emphasized#e171 that the government's fee-forfeiture power is to be used#e173 sparingly. According#e226 to department policy, prosecutors must make a strong showing#e176 that lawyers' fees came#e177 from assets tainted by illegal profits before any attempts#e179 at seizure#e181 are made#e183.

Still, criminal defense lawyers worry#e184 that defendants are being deprived#e185 of their Sixth Amendment right to counsel and a fair trial#e188 if the government can seize#e190 lawyers' fees. They also worry#e228 that if the government applies#e193 asset-forfeiture laws broadly, the best defense lawyers will be unwilling#e230 to take#e196 criminal cases unless they are assured#e198 of being paid#e199.
