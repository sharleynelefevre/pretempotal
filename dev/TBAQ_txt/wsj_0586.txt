Perspective


London share prices closed#e1 sharply lower Friday#t199 in active trading after Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson's resignation#e4 slapped#e5 the market and Wall Street's rapid initial sell-off knocked#e7 it down.

London shares were depressed#e203 initially by overnight#t207 losses#e202 in New York and by the drop#e208 in sterling after Mr. Lawson's resignation#e10. It showed some early resilience after central bank support firmed#e15 sterling, but the weight of Wall Street late in London trading, and signs of further weakness in the British pound, proved a hefty load to bear#e21. New York stocks recovered#e22 some of their losses after the London market closed#e23.

The Financial Times 100-share index shed#e24 47.3 points to close#e26 at 2082.1, down 4.5% from the#t215 previous#t215 Friday#t215 and 6.8% from Oct.#t217 13#t217, when Wall Street's plunge#e28 helped#e29 spark#e30 the current#t218 weakness#e219 in London.

The 30-share index settled#e32 42.0 points lower at 1678.5. Volume was 840.8 million shares, up from 443.6 million Thursday#t225 and the#t226 week#t226's most active session.

Dealers said#e34 the turnover, largely confined to the 100-share index stocks, partly reflected#e36 the flurry#e37 of activity typical at the close#e39 of a two-week#t230 trading account and the start#e229 of a new account. But they said#e43 Friday#t231's focus on the top-tier stocks telegraphed#e45 active overseas selling#e46 and showed#e47 the broad-based fears over the status of the U.K. economy and Britain's currency in the wake of the upheaval#e50 in Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's cabinet.

A senior dealer with Warburg Securities noted#e51 British Gas, the most active blue-chip stock at 20 million shares traded, was affected#e54 by the political implications of Mr. Lawson's departure#e55 and Mrs. Thatcher's cabinet shuffle#e56.

He attributed#e57 the unusually high volume to broad-based selling#e239 on fears that the Thatcher government may be in#e1353 turmoil and Britain's Labor Party positioned#e61 to regain#e63 control of the government and renew#e240 efforts#e241 at nationalization#e66.

British Gas shed#e68 8.5 pence a share to close#e70 at 185 pence ($2.90).

Other dealers added#e71 that the blue-chip stocks in general were hit#e73 by profit-taking over concerns that London shares will continue#e74 posting#e75 declines#e244 and the uncertainty over sterling given that Mr. Lawson's successor, John Major, had only been in the job one#t247 day#t247.

Besides British Gas, British Steel skidded#e80 1.74 to 123.5 on turnover of 11 million shares.

British Petroleum fell#e81 5 to 286 on 14 million shares traded. Dealers said#e84 the multinational oil company was pressured#e85 by recent brokerage recommendations urging#e87 investors to switch#e89 into Shell Trading amp Transport. Shell eased#e90 1 to 416 on turnover of 4.8 million shares.

Among the other actively traded blue-chip issues, Imperial Chemical Industries dropped#e91 11 to #10.86, Hanson skidded#e92 9.5 to 200.5, and British Telecom fell#e93 10 to 250.

In Tokyo, stocks closed#e94 lower but above intraday lows in active trading. The Nikkei index was pressured#e98 down by profit-taking#e265 triggered#e99 by sharp advances#e100 made through this#t264 week#t264 and fell#e102 151.20 points to 35527.29.

In early trading#e103 in Tokyo Monday#t269, the Nikkei index fell#e105 148.85 points to 35378.44.

On Friday#t274, the Tokyo stock price index of first section issues was down 15.82 at 2681.76. First-section volume was estimated#e106 at 1.3 billion shares, up from 886 million shares Thursday#t275.

An official at Wako Securities said#e109 brokerages' excessive expectations about recent#t280 advances#e110 in Tokyu Group shares and real estate issues were dashed#e111 Friday#t281.

Dealers placed#e112 heavy buy orders in the#t282 morning#t282 to start#e118 the first trading day#t941 for November#t283 transactions#e120. But they failed#e121 to sell#e123 these stocks to client investors, who were cautious#e285 about the sharp gains#e286 these issues made#e126 this#t287 week#t287, the Wako official said#e127.

Fund managers said#e129 Friday#t288's profittaking#e290 was a natural result#e998 of the#t293 week#t293's "abnormal fever" in buying#e132 real estate, shipbuilding, steel and construction shares.

Frankfurt prices closed#e134 lower again Friday#t294, the fourth decline#e296 in the#t298 past#t298 five#t298 days#t298 and the culmination#e300 of a#t301 week#t301 that saw the DAX index lose#e136 4%. The DAX dropped#e137 19.69 points Friday#t302 to 1462.93.

Traders said#e138 the continued turbulence#e305 in other markets, coupled with the drop#e306 in London following the Lawson resignation#e307, were responsible#e310.

Traders said#e143 that selling pressure wasn't enormous and that the DAX dropped#e145 Friday#t316 more on a lack of any substantial buying interest. They said#e147 contributing to the downward drift#e318 was the fact that many professional traders had chosen#e150 to square#e317 positions ahead of the#t322 weekend#t322.

"It's the whole uncertainty about what's happening around us," said#e130 Valentin Von Korff, a trader at Credit Suisse First Boston in Frankfurt.

"If you take#e131 away the outside influences, the market itself looks very cheap. What's happening here isn't justified by the fundamentals."

Traders said the market remains extremely nervous because of the wild swings seen on the New York Stock Exchange last#t326 week#t326. That's leaving small investors with cold feet, they said, and prompting institutions to take a reserved stance on the sidelines as well, at least until the market in New York settles#e328 down somewhat.

Elsewhere, share prices closed#e173 lower in Paris, Zurich, Amsterdam, Brussels and Stockholm, and were mixed#e330 in Milan. The British shakeup#e331 was widely cited#e174 for the declines#e332.

Share prices also closed#e175 lower in Sydney, Hong Kong, Singapore, Taipei, Manila, Wellington and Seoul. Concern about declines#e335 in other markets, especially New York, caused#e336 selling pressure#e337.

Here are price trends on the world's major stock markets, as calculated#e179 by Morgan Stanley Capital International Perspective, Geneva. To make them directly comparable, each index is based on the close of 1969 equaling 100. The percentage change#e186 is since year-end#t341.
