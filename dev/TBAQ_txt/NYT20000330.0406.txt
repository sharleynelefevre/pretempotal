MIAMI _

Even miles away from sign-waving demonstrators who keep#e2 vigil outside the tiny house in Little Havana where Elian Gonzalez lives with his great-uncle, talk#e3 about the standoff#e106 between Elian's Miami relatives and Immigration and Naturalization Service officials pours#e146 hot and quick from coffee stands on Calle Ocho and any other place Cuban Americans gather#e5.

In rapid-fire Spanish, so fast that even people who learned#e6 the language in other Hispanic cultures can have trouble keeping#e7 up, they villify#e147 Attorney General Janet Reno, President Clinton and others who want#e8 to send#e9 the child back to his father in Cuba. And they question#e10 _ or ridicule#e108 _ news that the boy's father is planning#e11 to come#e12 here to retrieve#e13 his son.

It is a Communist plot hatched#e148 by the hated dictator, Fidel Castro, they say#e14. If you are not Cuban, they said#e15, you just would not understand#e16.

``If it weren't Cuba, the child should go#e17 to be with his father,'' said#e18 Delfina Miranda, 49, who works#e19 at a beauty salon in Little Havana. ``But it is Cuba. That kid will get#e20 nothing in Cuba. Well, maybe electro-shock treatment, so they can brain-wash#e149 him.''

Over and over, Cuban Americans said#e22 that outsiders who did not suffer#e23 under the Castro regime simply could not understand#e24 their passions in the Elian standoff#e111.

As talk on the streets swirled#e150, talks#e25 between lawyers for Elian's Miami relatives and government officials crept#e26 to an uneventful close#e151.

U.S. Immigration officials postponed#e27 until#s1 Tuesday#t1 morning#t1 any action on revoking#e28 the boy's temporary permission to stay#e29 in the United States, which would allow#e30 federal officials to, ultimately, take#e31 the boy from his relatives' house and eventually return#e152 him to Cuba. ``Like the family, we are monitoring#e32 developments#e115 concerning the possible arrival#e116 of (Elian's father) Juan Miguel Gonzalez in the United States,'' said#e34 Robert Wallis, INS director for the Miami district.

Government officials had threatened#e35 to revoke#e36 the boy's parole if his great-uncle, Lazaro Gonzalez, did not sign#e37 a document agreeing#e38 to hand#e39 Elian over to federal officials once the family's appeal#e118 in the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals was decided#e153.

But that standoff#e119 became#e40 less important in the eyes of Cuban Americans here after#s3 Castro announced#e41 Wednesday#t3 that the boy's father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, is ready to travel#e42 to the United States to take#e43 his son home.

Gonzalez's lawyer, Greg Craig, asked#e44 for a visa Thursday#t4 for his client for the expected visit#e120, but was told#e46 by U.S. State Department officials that Gonzalez himself had to apply#e154 for the visa at the U.S. diplomatic mission in Havana.

``Juan Miguel Gonzalez is ready at a moment's notice to come#e47 to the United States,'' said#e48 Craig.

But in Miami, many Cuban Americans said#e49 Castro is orchestrating#e50 the visit#e123.

Castro said#e51 Gonzalez would travel#e52 with his current#t5 wife and their son, a top government official, doctors, nurses, psychiatrists, Elian's Cuban kindergarten teacher, classmates and his old school desk.A list of 31 people issued#e53 by the Cuban government Thursday#t6 included Ricardo Alarcon, president of Cuba's National Assembly. Castro has suggested#e55 that Elian and his relatives stay#e56 at the residence of Cuba's chief diplomat in Washington.

Hidden in the entourage, cautioned#e57 Cuban Americans here, will be Cuban security agents who will make#e58 sure that Gonzalez _ and everyone else, for that matter _ does not defect#e127.

``They are coming#e59 with everyone, including psychologists,'' said#e61 Armando Sanjurjo, 73. ``You know#e62 why? To give#e63 Elian an injection and take#e64 him back to Cuba.''

Sanjurjo, sipping#e155 a cafecito in front of Versailles restaurant, the nerve center for Cuban political discussions here in Little Havana, is convinced#e156, like many others here, the entourage is designed#e65 to prevent#e66 any defections#e131.

``He's coming#e67 with an entire court of people? What's that about?'' said#e68 Angela Esparragera, 71.

Miranda said#e69 Elian's father will be ``a virtual prisoner here if he comes#e70 with all those people. He'll be surrounded by people if he goes#e71 to the bathroom.''

Gloria Estefan, the wildly popular singer of Cuban descent who has become#e72 an entertainment and cultural icon, was also suspicious of this visit#e134.

``If in fact, Elian's father is permitted#e73 by the dictatorship of Fidel Castro to come#e74 to the United States, then, as a Cuban American, I welcome#e75 him and urge#e76 him to make#e77 all his decisions#e135 based on the well being and best interest of his son, and not that of the Cuban government,'' Estefan said#e79.

All week, elected officials in Washington, D.C., and at the state capital in Tallahassee have issued#e81 statement#e137 of support for Elian's Miami relatives, even Vice President Al Gore, breaking#e82 from his own administration's stand. In Miami-Dade County, elected officials went#e84 as far as to say#e85 they their police departments would have no role in taking#e86 the boy from the house.

Among non-Cuban Americans, there was a drastic shift in their feelings on the case.

``Send#e158 him back,'' said#e87 Marsha Raeber, 47, an airline employee. ``There are rules and regulations in this country. Some people are born#e88 rich, some people are born#e89 poor. That's the luck of the draw#e145. Who's to say#e90 that he's better off at Disney World and eating#e91 fast food here instead if breathing the fresh air of Cuba.''

Eric Pichardo, 44, is from Nicaragua, and said#e92 the Cuban-Americans ``need#e93 to follow#e94 the law. What about all the other poor kids in South and Central America?''

Not all Cuban-Americans insist#e95 that Elian be allowed#e96 to stay#e97. Diana de Cardenas, 33, was born#e98 in Cuba in#s2 1984#t7. ``I think#e99 he deserves to be with his father,'' she said#e100. ``It would be ideal if his father came#e101,'' and then stayed#e102, in Miami.
