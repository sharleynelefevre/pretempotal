Now for today#t33's geography quiz#e1985.

We're off in search#e2 of an ancient and exotic city.

An officially sanctioned#e4 one, too. UNESCO declared#e5 it a protected site for its beauty and its historical significance.

The city could have used#e6 some special protection in nineteen#t34 seventy-nine#t34 when the Soviet Union invaded#e10 Afghanistan. Most of the city's monuments were destroyed#e11, including a magnificent tiled mosque, which dominated#e12 the skyline for centuries#t1982.

The people here are famous throughout central Asia for their skill in fashioning pottery and tile, glass too. Some families have kept#e1989 their glass working secrets for more#t1991 than#t1991 two#t1991 thousand#t1991 years#t1991.

Even though this city is in Afghanistan, most people here speak#e19 a dialect of the Persian language, and have#e22 long standing cultural ties with neighboring Iran.

Think#e25 you got#e26 it? Well, frankly, I don't, but the answer is coming#e30 up in just a#t1986 few#t1986 minutes#t1986.
