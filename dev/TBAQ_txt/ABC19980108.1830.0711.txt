On the other hand, it's turning#e1 out to be another very bad financial week#t83 for Asia. The financial assistance#e3 from the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund are not helping#e4. In the#t85 last#t85 twenty#t85 four#t85 hours#t85, the value of the Indonesian stock market has fallen#e7 by twelve percent. The Indonesian currency has lost#e9 twenty six percent of its value. In Singapore, stocks hit#e10 a five#t86 year#t86 low. In the Philippines, a four#t87 year#t87 low. And in Hong Kong, a three percent drop#e147. More problems in Hong Kong for a place, for an economy, that many experts thought#e11 was once invincible#e376. Here's ABC's Jim Laurie.

Not that long ago, before the Chinese takeover#e12, the news about real estate here was that the sky was the limit the highest prices in the world. So when Wong Kwan spent#e16 seventy million dollars for this house, he thought#e17 it was a great deal#e18. He sold#e19 the property to five buyers and said#e20 he'd double#e21 his money.

In Hong Kong, is always belongs to the seller's market.

Now#t196 with new construction#e26 under way, three of his buyers have backed#e28 out. And Wong Kwan will be lucky to break#e30 even. All across Hong Kong, the property market has crashed#e32. Pamela Pak owns#e33 eight condominiums here. Pak can't find#e34 buyers. She estimates#e37 her properties, worth#e88 a hundred thirty million dollars in October#t89, are worth#e91 only half that now#t90.

They believe#e39 ah it will be always up going#e40 up and up ah forever. Nobody believe#e41 this any more.

Of all of Asia's economies, Hong Kong is the most robust. But in the#t98 past#t98 three#t98 months#t98, stocks have plunged#e42, interest rates have soared#e43 and the downturn#e44 all across Asia means that people are not spending#e46 here.

Hotels are only thirty percent full. You can get#e48 seventy percent discounts#e50 at the shopping malls. Three thousand dollar pearls for eight hundred dollars. A two hundred dollar wool jacket for fifty dollars. Still, there are few buyers. And at the big brokerage houses, after ten#t99 years#t99 of boom#e52, they're talking#e53 about layoffs#e54.

I think#e55 that the mood is fairly gloomy#e374, and I think#e56 it's not going to change#e59 for a#t100 couple#t100 of#t100 years#t100.

So for Hong Kong, it's time, as investment bankers like to say, to reposition#e64. To either hold#e65 on tight or get#e66 out, as much of Asia goes#e67 into recession#e368. Jim Laurie, ABC News, Hong Kong.
