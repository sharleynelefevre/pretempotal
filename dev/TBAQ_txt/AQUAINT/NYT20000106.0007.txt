The New York Times says#e1 in an editorial on Thursday#t9, Jan.#t1 6#t1: &QL;

The U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service made#e2 a reasonable decision#e47 Wednesday#t3 in ruling#e48 that Elian Gonzalez, the 6-year-old boy who survived#e3 an ill-fated migrant smuggling trip#e50 across the Florida Straits, should be reunited#e72 with his father back in Cuba. The decision#e51 will inflame#e5 anti-Castro Cubans in Miami, but Doris Meissner, the INS commissioner, made#e6 it clear that the service had followed#e7 established policy in the case. Moreover, by setting#e9 a Jan.#t4 14#t4 return#e52 date, the immigration service allowed#e10 Elian's American relatives time to test#e11 the ruling#e54 in court.

Elian was one of 13 Cubans who were trying#e12 to cross#e13 from Cuba to Florida six#t5 weeks#t5 ago#t5 on a 17-foot aluminum powerboat when it capsized#e14. Ten of those on board died#e73, including his mother and stepfather. The boy clung#e16 to an inner tube for two#t6 days#t6 and was plucked#e17 from the Atlantic on#s1 Thanksgiving#t7 Day#t7 and brought#e18 ashore. He was immediately released#e19 into the custody of relatives in Miami _ and just as quickly embraced#e20 as a pawn in the poisonous estrangement between Fidel Castro's regime and its opponents in exile.

This page has argued#e21 from the start#e59 that Elian not be denied#e22 due process because of his youth, and the INS appears#e23 to have moved#e24 carefully. Elian's great-uncle and other American relatives were allowed#e25 to make#e26 their case that he should have a life in Miami. The boy's divorced#e27 father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, was also interviewed#e28 and satisfied#e74 the agency that he had a close and involved relationship with his son. The mother's parents also argued#e29 for a return#e61 to Cuba. The INS decided#e75 that under their prevailing policies, Gonzalez met#e30 the test that calls for custody reverting#e32 to the sole surviving parent in such cases.

``This little boy, who has been through so much, belongs with his father,'' Meissner said#e35 Wednesday#t8, adding#e76 that ``the unique relationship between parent and child and family reunification has long been a cornerstone of both American immigration law and INS practice.'' The White House quickly announced#e36 support for the decision#e68.

It is unclear how the political side of this affair will play#e37 out. Elian's relatives in Miami have indicated#e38 they plan#e39 to appeal#e40, as is their right. Some of their more militant supporters in Miami, decrying#e77 the prospect that the boy will be used#e41 as a ``trophy'' by Castro, have indicated#e42 they may try#e43 to disrupt#e44 efforts to reunite#e78 Elian with his father. That would be treating#e45 the boy as a trophy in a diplomatic struggle#e70 that predates his birth#e71 by decades.
