Castro: Elian, Dad To Be Reunited  By ANITA SNOW, Associated Press Writer



HAVANA (AP) --

President Fidel Castro declared#e1 Wednesday#t1 night#t1 that it is just matter of days before Elian Gonzalez will be reunited#e73 with his father.

''I am talking#e2 about three#t2 days#t2'' more or less, Castro told#e3 hundreds of university students from across Latin American and the Caribbean in town for a regional congress. ''It is inevitable.''

''The battle#e53 of Elian has been won#e4 -- in judicial terms, in legal terms, in political terms,'' Castro said#e5 as he wound#e6 up his speech#e54 at Havana's Karl Marx Theater.

Castro's statement#e55 came#e7 less than an hour after Gregory Craig, attorney for Elian's father Juan Miguel Gonzalez, announced#e8 in Washington that the father would be traveling#e9 to the United States Thursday#t3 with his wife, their 6-month-old son, and with Fernando Remirez, chief of the Cuban Interests Section in Washington.

''This courageous father will leave#e10 at#s1 4#t4 in#t4 the#t4 morning#t4 (4#t5 a.m.#t5 EDT#t5 Thursday#t5),'' Castro said#e11. ''And I, at least, will be there to see#e12 him off.''

He said#e13 the group would be met#e14 on arriving#e15 in Washington by Craig and Joan Brown Campbell of the National Council of Churches, who traveled#e16 with Craig on his lightning trip#e57 to Havana on#s2 Wednesday#t6.

The Cuban leader said#e17 that the U.S. government still did not know#e18 how it would transfer#e19 Elian to his father, but that it would happen quickly.

The U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service said#e21 earlier this#t7 week#t7 that once Gonzalez arrives#e22 in the United States it will begin#e23 the process to transfer#e24 Elian to his custody from the Miami relatives who have been caring#e25 for him since he was rescued#e26 off the coast of Florida in#s3 late#t9 November#t9.

The Miami kin has been battling#e27 to keep#e28 him in the United States, saying#e29 it can give#e30 him a better life off the communist island. But Gonzalez, backed#e31 by Castro, has demanded#e32 his rights as Elian's sole surviving parent and insisted#e34 that the child be returned#e35 to him.

Elian's mother perished#e74 along with 10 others when their boat sank#e36 during#s4 the crossing#e37 from Cuba to the United States. Since the tragedy#e62, Elian has become#e38 a political poster boy for Cubans with diametrically opposed#e39 ideologies living on both sides of the Florida Straits.

During#s5 his speech#e63 Wednesday#t10 night#t10, Castro expressed#e41 irritation that much of the rest of the delegation was not granted#e42 visas to travel#e43 to the United States to stay#e44 with Elian while waiting#e45 out a federal appeal filed#e46 by Elian's Miami relatives and assist#e47 in his ''rehabilitation.''

''More important than the doctors are those 12 children'' from Elian's first-grade class in Cuba, Castro said#e48.

Cuba had asked#e49 for 28 visas for the trip#e70, for Elian's father, his stepmother, his little half-brother, a 5th grade boy cousin, the dozen classmates, and a host of teachers, doctors and other specialists.

Also on the list was National Assembly President Ricardo Alarcon, who has served#e50 as adviser to Gonzalez over the#t12 past#t12 four#t12 months#t12 and a senior member of Cuba's communist leadership.

Ultimately, U.S. officials approved#e51 and delivered#e52 six visas, for the four family members, a pediatrician and Elian's teacher from his year in kindergarten.
