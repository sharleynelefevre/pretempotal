Warrant Issued for U.S. Fugitive



HAMILTON (AP) --

Canadian authorities issued#e1 a nationwide arrest warrant Monday#t2 for James Charles Kopp, a U.S. fugitive on#e2 the FBI's most wanted list for an alleged anti-abortion murder#e3.

Kopp also is wanted#e4 for questioning#e5 in at least two other shootings#e6 of doctors who performed#e7 abortions.

The Canadian warrant issued#e8 Monday#t3 charged#e9 Kopp with attempted murder in the 1995#t4 shooting#e10 of Dr. Hugh Short, who was wounded#e11 in the elbow but survived#e12 the attack#e13 at his home in Ancaster, Ontario.

``It allows#e14 us to spread#e15 his name far and wide across Canada and say#e16 that he is wanted#e17 for attempted murder,'' said#e18 police Inspector Dave Bowen.

Kopp, who is from Vermont, was indicted#e19 last#t5 year#t5 in the October#t6 1998#t6 shooting#e20 death of Dr. Barnet Slepian, an obstetrician in Buffalo, New York. He also is wanted#e21 in connection with the shooting#e22 of doctors in Winnipeg, Vancouver and Rochester, New York.

Slepian was killed#e23 by a single gunshot fired#e24 from a wooded area through a window of his home.

Kopp purports#e25 to be#e26 a devout Roman Catholic, and the majority of jobs he has held#e27 over#s1 the past#t7 20#t7 years#t7 have been related#e30 to the anti-abortion movement, the U.S. Justice Department said#e29 last#t8 year#t8. He has been arrested#e31 more than a dozen times during#s2 abortion protests#e32 in seven states and Italy.

The FBI says#e33 Kopp has used#e34 29 aliases. He was#e35 the 456th person to be placed#e36 on the FBI's most wanted list, which began#e37 in#s3 1950#t9. Since#s4 then, 427 fugitives have been taken#e38 into custody or located#e39, 133 of them as a result of citizen assistance#e40, the FBI said#e41.

A total of $650,000 is being offered#e42 in the United States for information leading#e43 to Kopp's arrest#e44.
