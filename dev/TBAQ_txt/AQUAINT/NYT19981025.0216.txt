AMHERST, N.Y.: happen here.



Additional details of the slaying#e1 emerged#e2 on#s1 Sunday#t2. Slepian's lawyer, Glenn Edward Murray, said#e4 the sniper's bullet entered#e5 through a partially draped kitchen window, hit#e6 Slepian in the back and exited#e7 through his chest. The doctor's wife and one of his sons were#e8 in the kitchen when the shooting occurred#e9, Murray said#e10.

The bullet bounced#e11 off a cabinet and ricocheted#e12 into the living room, where the doctor's three other children were watching#e13 television, Murray said#e14. Slepian's wife and one son tried#e15 to revive#e16 him. Just over#t3 an#t3 hour#t3 later, he was declared#e17 dead at nearby Millard Fillmore Suburban Hospital.

For the most part, people on both sides of the abortion issue expressed#e18 outrage at the shooting#e19. But one abortion opponent, the Rev. Donald Spitz, the founder of Pro-Life Virginia, described#e20 Slepian's killer as a ``hero'' for ending#e21 the physician's ``bloodthirsty practice#e22.''

``We as Christians have#e23 a responsibility to protect#e24 the innocent from being murdered#e25,'' Spitz said#e26 in a statement released#e27 to The Associated Press, ``the same way we would want#e28 someone to protect#e29 us. Whoever shot#e30 the shot protected#e31 the children.''

Most other opponents of abortion, however, condemned#e32 the shooting#e33 and abortion.

In his Sunday#t4 Mass at St. Patrick's Cathedral in New York, Cardinal John O'Connor called#e34 the murder wrong but he urged#e35 those angered by the slaying#e37 to be#e38 equally angered by abortions. ``He called#e41 on many of the same people to express#e42 outrage at partial birth abortion, which he called#e43 the equivalent of infanticide,'' Joseph Zwilling, a spokesman for the Archdiocese of New York, said#e44 of the cardinal's sermon.

Religious leaders in Buffalo also condemned#e45 the shooting#e46. Bishop Henry Mansell of the Archdiocese of Buffalo said#e47 it was#e48 ``an act of madness,'' but he went on to defend#e50 the Church's opposition to abortion as ``respecting of human life in all its forms, especially the most vulnerable.''

Susan Dudley, deputy director of the National Abortion Federation, assailed#e51 the remarks and called#e52 on anti-abortion groups to shift#e53 their tactics. She said#e54 the rhetoric of the anti-abortion movement has helped#e55 lead#e56 to violent attacks#e57 against abortion providers.

``I think#e58 that when pro-life organizations try#e59 to distinguish#e60 between themselves and these incidents they are at best being#e62 disingenuous,'' she said#e63. ``They are the ones who call#e65 these doctors murderers.''

In Amherst, residents who said#e66 they opposed#e67 abortion decried#e68 the attack#e69 and said#e70 they hoped#e71 the perpetrator was caught#e72.

Men smoking#e73 cigars and drinking#e74 beer with friends after#s2 shooting#e75 skeet at the Buffalo Shooting Club in Amherst said#e76 their feelings about abortion were#e78 mixed, but they uniformly denounced#e79 the killing#e80 of Slepian.

Many residents said#e81 abortion had gradually dwindled#e82 as a local issue since#s3 Operation Rescue, an anti-abortion group, started#e83 a series of largely unsuccessful ``Spring of Life'' demonstrations#e84 in#s4 1992#t5 intended#e85 to shut#e86 down abortion clinics and harass#e87 local doctors, including Slepian.

Little of the vitriol that the issue aroused#e88 in#s6 the late 1980s#t7 and early 1990s#t8 remains#e89, residents said#e90, and many of the local religious leaders who led#e91 the 1992#t9 protests#e92 have moved#e93.

``The only people that are left#e94 are#e95 the hard-core, fanatical people,'' said#e96 Larry Finkelstien, a high school teacher who works#e97 as an escort at abortion clinics. ``Everyone else has gone#e98 away.''
