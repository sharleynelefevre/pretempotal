WASHINGTON _

A six-year-old boy who arrived#e1 on US shores as a motherless refugee and became#e2 a political symbol for anti-Castro exiles must be returned#e3 to his father in Cuba, immigration authorities ruled#e4 Wednesday#t1.

Faced with the choice of keeping Elian Gonzalez with relatives in Miami, where the boy has been wooed#e6 with American toys and theme-park visits#e94, or returning#e7 him to his apparently distraught father in Havana, the Immigration and Naturalization Service decided#e137 the boy should go#e8 home by#s1 Jan.#t2 14#t2, INS commissioner Doris Meissner told#e9 reporters.

``This little boy, who has been through so much, belongs with his father,'' Meissner told#e11 a news conference#e95. ``The core issue here is the bond between the parent and the child.''

The decision#e97 was met#e12 with outrage by Cuban-Americans, who said#e13 the youngster will suffer#e14 under the repressive communist regime of Fidel Castro. Lawyers for the boy's family in Miami sent#e15 letters of protest to Attorney General Janet Reno and President Clinton and said#e16 they were prepared#e17 to file#e18 a court appeal#e100 if Reno and Clinton spurn#e19 the Gonzalez family.

Anti-Castro demonstrators thronged#e138 the street near the local INS office in Miami Wednesday#t3, demanding#e20 that Elian be allowed#e21 to stay#e22.

``Today#t4 is a sad day for the US Constitution . . . and for the hopes and dreams of Elian's mother Elizabeth,'' who died#e139 with nine other adults when their boat sank#e23 as they attempted#e24 to reach#e25 Florida, said#e26 Roger Bernstein, representing#e27 the Miami Gonzalez family.

``Nobody wants#e28 the boy to be separated#e140 from his father,'' said#e29 Ninoska Perez of the Miami-based Cuban-American National Foundation. ``But that little boy, by surviving#e31 two#t5 days#t5 on an inner tube, has earned#e141 the right to stay#e32 here in freedom.''

In Havana, the government gave#e33 a guarded first response#e105 to the INS ruling#e106, warning#e107 against ``excessive optimism'' and predicting#e35 ``the Cuban-American mafia and the extreme right in the U.S. Congress'' would still put#e36 up a fight#e109 to keep#e37 the boy.

Meissner said#e38 the INS decision#e110 was made after two lengthy interviews#e111 with the boy's father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, a hotel worker in Cardenas, Cuba, who Meissner said#e40 is anxious to have Elian returned#e41 to him.

Since the boy is so young, Meissner said#e42, the natural father has the right to speak#e43 for Elian.

There is ``no information'' that Gonzalez, who was divorced#e44 from Elian's mother, is an unfit father, nor that he has been coerced#e142 by the Castro regime into pleading#e45 for his son's return#e112, Meissner said#e46.

Spencer Eig, an attorney for the Gonzalez family in Miami, said#e47 Meissner's assumptions were ``unconstitutional and untrue.''

``Elian cannot apply#e143 for asylum from persecution by the Fidel Castro government,'' Eig complained. ``If only his father, who is under the control of the Fidel Castro regime, can do#e48 it for him . . . that is deeply unfair and untrue.''

Meissner gave#e49 no reason for the Jan.#t6 14#t6 deadline, and it is still unclear how Elian would be transported#e50 back to Cuba if the Gonzalez family's appeals#e116 are unsuccessful.

The INS offered#e51 three options: that Gonzalez come#e52 to pick#e53 up his son, that the family in Miami take#e117 him to Cuba, or that a ``third party'' escort#e118 the child to his homeland.

Gonzalez _ perhaps under duress from the Castro regime _ has indicated#e54 he does not want#e55 to travel#e56 to Miami, and there is ``no way'' the Miami Gonzalezes will assist#e57 in sending#e58 Elian back to Cuba, Perez said#e59.

Having a third party escort#e144 Elian frees#e60 the INS from the politically uncomfortable spectacle of having to do#e61 the task itself. The Cuban-American lobby is a locally powerful political force few politicians want#e62 to provoke#e63.

Clinton has sought#e64 to distance himself from the controversy#e122 from the start#e123. ``I told#e65 you when we started#e66 this I would do#e67 my best to keep#e68 the decision#e124 out of politics,'' Clinton told#e69 reporters in the Rose Garden Wednesday#t7. ``We have done that.''

But if Elian is forced#e70 to go#e71 back to Cuba, ``the Clinton-Gore administration, specifically (Vice President) Al Gore, will pay#e72 a high price in terms of votes in Florida,'' Perez said#e73.

Cuba experts and child custody lawyers said#e74 the INS ruling#e129 was appropriate under the law.

``It's high time'' the boy was sent#e75 back to his birthplace, said#e76 Wayne Smith, a former Clinton administration adviser on Cuba. ``This was a simple child custody case.''

``Every state court and every family court in the United States would award#e133 custody to a surviving parent rather than a distant relative who lives#e78 a more prosperous life,'' said#e79 David Abraham, a professor at Miami Law School and expert in custody law.

``We may have the Disneylands and the Universal Studios and all the things that were dangled#e80 before the little boy's eyes,'' Abraham added. ``But that's his home.''

With the political implications so strong, it's unlikely the case of Elian Gonzalez will be closed#e81 quickly, said#e82 Richard Nuccio, a former Clinton administration Cuba adviser.

``With two members of Congress representing#e83 Elian's family's constituency, I don't see#e85 how Elian could be returned#e86 by the federal government without it going#e87 through the court system,'' Nuccio said#e88.
