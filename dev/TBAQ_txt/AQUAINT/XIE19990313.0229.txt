WASHINGTON, March 12 (Xinhua) --

Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic Friday#t2 formally joined#e1 NATO at a ceremony#e2 held#e3 in the city of Independence, Missouri.

At the Harry Truman Library in Independence, the three foreign ministers of Bronislaw Geremek of Poland, Janos Martonyi of Hungary and Jan Kavan of the Czech Republic signed#e4 formal documents of accession.

In speeches#e5 before the signing ceremony#e6, the ministers said#e7 their countries saw#e8 NATO membership as an assurance of security and recognition of their rightful place in Europe.

Kavan said#e9 the Czech Republic would no longer become#e10 "the powerless victim of a foreign invasion."

Martonyi called#e11 Hunragy's admission#e12 in NATO "returning#e13 to her natural habitat," saying#e14: "It has been#e15 our manifest destiny to rejoin#e16 those with whom we share#e17 the same values, interests and goals."

And Geremek said#e18 it was#e19 "a great day#t3 for Poland and for the world."

U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright accepted#e20 admission papers from the three countries' foreign ministers, marking#e21 their formal entry#e22 into the 50-year-old Western alliance. "Hallelujah," exclaimed#e23 Albright, a daughter of Czechoslovakia, who as a child fled#e24 her native land and later became#e25 a U.S. citizen.

Ahead#s2 of#s2 the ceremony#e26, NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana said#e27 that the accession#e28 of the three countries..."is#e29 perhaps the clearest demonstration of the fact that Europe is growing#e30 closer together."

"Extending#e31 membership to these three democracies helps#e32 to stabilize#e33 a region that historically has been#e34 the staging ground for many of the disasters#e35 of#s1 this#t4 century,#t4" Solana added#e44, referring#e36 to the two world wars#e37.

The U.S. State Department has said#e38 the three new members "enhance#e39 NATO's ability to fulfill#e40 its core mission of collective defense, respond#e41 to a range of security challenges and reduce#e42 the possibility of another major conflict in Europe of the kind that has claimed#e43 so many American lives."
