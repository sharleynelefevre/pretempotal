EDITORIAL: VIOLENCE AGAINST ABORTION DOCTORS

c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service



The New York Times said#e1 in an editorial on#s1 Monday,#t2 Oct.#t2 26#t2:

The murder#e2 of Dr. Barnett Slepian is the latest depraved assault#e3 on the small number of courageous physicians who still risk#e4 their safety to perform#e5 legal abortions in this country. Slepian was#e6 one of only three doctors who performed#e7 abortions in the Buffalo, N.Y., area, and harassment and threats against him by anti-abortion groups had become#e8 routine over#s2 the past#t3 decade#t3. He persevered#e9 through courage and a belief in the right of his patients to choose#e10 whether to bear#e11 a child.

But a principled commitment#e12 to provide#e13 a constitutionally protected service#e14 could not stop#e15 the assassin's bullet that tore#e16 through his kitchen window and into his back Friday#t4 night. His death shows#e17 again how tentative the right to abortion has become#e18 in the face of terrorism#e19 by anti-choice fanatics.

Their repeated acts#e20 of terrorism must be met#e21 with the severest possible crackdown#e22 by law-enforcement authorities. If an armed police officer has to be stationed#e23 outside every abortion provider's home and office, 24 hours a day, let it be done#e24. This is an assault#e25 not only on individual doctors but on the rights and liberties of all Americans.

Last#t5 week#t5 the FBI joined#e26 Canadian authorities to investigate#e27 a series of unsolved sniper shootings#e28 of doctors in Canada and western New York dating to#s3 1994#t6. In#s5 January#t7, a week#t8 after#s4 the 25th anniversary#e29 of the Roe vs. Wade Supreme Court decision, a clinic bombing#e31 in Birmingham, Ala., killed#e32 a security guard and severely wounded#e33 a nurse.

Since#s6 1993#t9, three doctors, including Slepian, three clinic employees and a clinic escort have been murdered#e34. There have been#e35 more than a dozen attempted murders#e36 of abortion providers in#s7 the last#t10 five#t10 years#t10. Arson#e37 and bombings#e38 at clinics have become#e39 so common that many no longer make#e40 the national news.

It is#e41 bad enough that conservatives in Congress and in state legislatures are working#e42 to dismantle#e43 reproductive rights by banning#e44 certain procedures#e45, such as so-called partial birth abortion, and by requiring#e46 waiting periods#e47 and parental consent#e48 before#s8 an abortion can be obtained#e49. But those restrictions are at least imposed#e50 by the normal give and take of political and judicial struggle#e51 in a democracy.

What is#e52 outrageous is the attempt#e53 to shut#e54 down abortions by illegal means _ by shooting#e55 the doctors or bombing#e56 the clinics or harassing#e57 the women seeking#e58 to exercise#e59 their constitutional right. Some anti-abortion groups, to their credit, have denounced#e60 the bombings#e61 and shootings#e62, but others seem#e63 reluctant to issue#e64 the strong condemnations#e65 that are warranted#e66.

Indeed, one particularly virulent anti-abortion Web site lists#e67 the names of doctors it says#e68 perform#e69 abortions, or ``crimes against humanity,'' with a code indicating#e70 whether they are ``working#e71,'' ``wounded#e72'' or a ``fatality#e73.'' Such incendiary rhetoric#e74, and frequent accusations#e75 by some anti-abortionists that abortion providers are committing#e76 murder, can only fuel#e77 more terrorism.

The increase#e78 of anti-choice laws and ongoing campaigns#e79 of harassment by protest groups, even short of murder, have worked#e80 to make#e81 abortions harder to obtain#e82. More than 80 percent of counties in this country have#e83 no abortion provider. In 45 states, the number of doctors who performed#e84 abortions declined#e85 between#s9 1982#t11 and 1992#t12.

Slepian was#e86 among those who took#e87 a stand against restricting#e88 reproductive freedom and paid#e89 with his life. Unless these brave doctors are better protected#e90, fewer doctors in the next generation will be willing#e91 to place#e92 themselves and their families in such danger. That is what the terrorists want#e93. They must not be allowed#e94 to succeed#e95.
