Bomb-interrupted talks concluded; Tanzania toll rises to 12



NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _

U.S. Ambassador Prudence Bushnell wrapped#e1 up some unfinished business on#s2 Wednesday#t1, meeting#e28 with Kenya's trade minister to finish#e2 talks#e30 that were interrupted#e3 by the car bombing#e31 of the embassy.

On#s3 Aug.#t2 7#t2, Bushnell, Trade Minister Joseph Kimotho and others had just ended#e4 a news conference#e32 in a building adjacent to the embassy. They were talking#e5 when the bomb went#e6 off, killing#e7 247 people and wounding#e8 more than 5,000 others.

On#s4 Wednesday#t3, Bushnell and Kimotho met#e9 again to finish#e10 their discussion#e33, Bushnell told#e11 Kenya Television.

The ambassador was cut#e12 on her lip and hands in the blast#e35, which damaged#e13 the embassy, shattered#e14 the glass shell of the 22-story Cooperative Bank House and toppled#e15 the six-story Ufundi House.

Bushnell continued#e53 with her duties throughout the subsequent search and rescue at the blast#e39 scene, memorials for those slain, and the relocation#e41 to a temporary embassy.

Kimotho, who was hospitalized#e18 with a head wound, said#e19 he and Bushnell had been talking#e20 about the slated visit#e43 of U.S. Commerce Secretary William Daley in#s5 September#t4. His trip#e44 is still on, the embassy said#e22.

The blast#e45 in Nairobi occurred at almost exactly the same moment as an explosion#e46 ripped#e24 through the American Embassy in Tanzania's commercial capital Dar es Salaam.

The death toll in the Tanzania blast#e49, initially 10, has risen#e25 to 12, hospital officials and family members said#e26 Wednesday#t5. That brought the toll for both bombings#e52 to 259.
