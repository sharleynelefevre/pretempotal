Bin Laden, Kopp on Most-Wanted List



WASHINGTON (AP) --

The FBI put#e1 alleged terrorist mastermind Osama Bin Laden and anti-abortion activist and accused#e2 doctor killer James Charles Kopp on the bureau's list of the Ten Most Wanted fugitives Monday#t2.

FBI Director Louis Freeh said#e3 the U.S. government is offering#e4 a reward of up to $5 million for information that leads#e5 to the arrest#e6 and conviction#e7 of Bin Laden, indicted#e8 as the architect of the twin bombings#e9 of American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. The Aug.#t3 7,#t3 1998#t3, bombings#e10 killed#e11 more than 200 people, including 12 Americans. It is#e12 the largest reward the government has ever offered#e13 for a fugitive.

A total of $650,000, meanwhile, is being offered#e14 for information leading#e15 to the arrest#e16 of Kopp, who is charged#e17 with gunning#e18 down Dr. Barnett Slepian last#t4 fall#t4 in his home in Buffalo, N.Y. Slepian provided#e19 legal abortions#e20 in western New York state.

The standard $50,000 reward for information leading#e21 to a listed fugitive's capture#e22 comes#e23 on top of a $500,000 reward announced#e24 earlier by Attorney General Janet Reno, plus a $100,000 award offered#e25 previously by the FBI.

Reno said#e26 Bin Laden and Kopp have#e27 one thing in common: Each wrongly believes#e28 he is justified#e29 in using#e30 all means possible to achieve#e31 his goal.

They also have#e32 in common locations unknown#e33 to the authorities.

Freeh said#e34 Bin Laden may be hiding#e35 out in Afghanistan, which has been#e36 uncooperative in the case#e37. Kopp, meanwhile, may have approached#e38 the border with Mexico, but it is unknown#e39 whether he crossed#e40 into that country, said#e41 Freeh.

Kopp purports#e42 to be#e43 a devout Roman Catholic, and the majority of jobs he has held#e44 over#s1 the past#t5 20#t5 years#t5 have been#e47 related to the anti-abortion movement, the Justice Department said#e46 in a news release.

State Department international security director Dave Carpenter said#e48 that placing#e49 Bin Laden on the most-wanted list ``underscores#e50 the unwavering commitment#e51'' by the United States ``to fight#e52 terrorism.'' The FBI continues#e53 to receive#e54 threats from individuals and organizations with ties to Bin Laden, Freeh said#e55.

Carpenter said#e56 the U.S. government's counterterrorism program has paid#e57 out over $6 million in some 20 cases around the world for credible information.

On the FBI list, Bin Laden and Kopp replace#e58 two former Libyan intelligence agents charged#e59 in the Dec.#t6 21,#t6 1988#t6, bombing#e60 of Pan Am Flight 103 that killed#e97 259 people on the plane and 11 on the ground in Lockerbie, Scotland. The two were removed#e61 from the list after#s7 Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi agreed#e62 in#s2 April#t7 to hand#e63 them over for trial in the Netherlands, a neutral venue. Lamen Khalifa Fhimah and Abdel Basset Ali al-Megrahi are charged#e64 with murder, conspiracy to commit#e65 murder and violations#e66 of international aviation safety laws.

Bin Laden and Kopp are#e67 the 455th and 456th persons to be placed#e68 on the FBI's most wanted list, which began#e69 in#s3 1950#t8. Since#s4 then, 427 fugitives have been taken#e70 into custody or located#e71, 133 of them as a result of citizen assistance#e72, the FBI said#e73.

Six suspects in the Bin Laden investigation are known#e74 to be#e75 in custody in the Metropolitan Correctional Center in New York. Another eight suspects, including Bin Laden, have been charged#e76 but not apprehended#e77. Another suspect is awaiting#e78 extradition#e79 from Britain. The FBI says#e80 Bin Laden is#e81 the leader of a terrorist organization known#e82 as Al-Aqeda, ``The Base.''

Kopp wears#e83 eyeglasses, walks#e84 with a slight limp, is#e85 5 feet, 10 inches tall and weighs#e86 150 to 175 pounds. Slepian was killed#e87 by a single gunshot fired#e88 from a wooded area through a window of his home.

Prior#s5 to#s5 the Slepian's shooting#e89, Kopp had traveled#e90 the country and world, authorities said#e91. He has been arrested#e92 more than a dozen times during#s6 abortion protests#e93 in seven states and Italy, but has#e94 no felony convictions.

He has used#e95 29 aliases, Freeh said#e96.
