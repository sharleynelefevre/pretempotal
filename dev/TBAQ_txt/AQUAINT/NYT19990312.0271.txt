INDEPENDENCE, Mo. _ The North Atlantic Treaty Organization embraced#e1 three of its former rivals, the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland on#s1 Friday#t3, formally ending#e2 the Soviet domination#e3 of those nations that began#e4 after#s2 World War#e5 II and opening#e6 a new path for the military alliance.

In a ceremony#e7 tinged with the personal and the emotional at the Truman Presidential Library here, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright watched#e8 the foreign ministers of the three countries sign#e9 the documents of accession to the alliance, signed#e10 them herself and then held#e11 them aloft like a victory trophy.

Albright, who was born#e12 in Prague and fled#e13 just after#s3 the Communist takeover#e14 in#s4 1948#t4, made#e15 no secret of her joy at her homeland and its neighbors joining#e16 the alliance after#s5 a six#t5 year#t5 trans-Atlantic diplomatic process#e17 led#e18 by the Clinton administration.

``To quote#e20 an old Central European expression, `Hallelujah,''' she said#e19.

In Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic, the moment was marked#e21 by small-scale public celebrations#e22. In Warsaw, Poland, after dark, as fireworks lit#e23 the sky, the Polish flag and the flag of NATO were raised#e24 side by side near the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in Pilsudski Square

In Hungary, NATO members' flags were raised#e25 outside the Defense Ministry. And in Prague, Czech Republic, President Vaclav Havel said#e26 in a statement#e27, ``Never have we been#e28 part of such a broad, solid and binding security alliance which at the same time respects#e29 in its essence the sovereignty#e30 and will#e31 of our nation.''

The enlargement#e32 of NATO from 16 members to 19 has been#e33 one of the administration's foremost foreign policy goals, one that grew#e34 out of a desire#e35, its proponents said#e36, to cement#e37 the democratic gains#e39 made in the former Warsaw Pact countries after#s6 the collapse#e38 of communism 10#t6 years#t6 ago#t6.

But the policy also faced#e40 critics, who argued#e41 that welcoming#e42 these three new countries would draw#e43 a new line across Europe and antagonize#e44 the Russians. As#s7 of#s7 Friday#t7, the border between Western Europe and the former Soviet Union moved#e45 to the eastern border of Poland.

In her speech#e46, in the small auditorium where dignitaries from the three countries sat#e47 and the three foreign ministers flanked#e48 her on the stage, Albright countered#e49 that NATO would now do#e50 ``for Europe's East what NATO has already helped#e51 to do#e52 for Europe's West. Steadily and systematically, we will continue#e53 erasing#e54 _ without replacing#e55 _ the line drawn#e56 in Europe by Stalin's bloody boot.''

Albright also used#e59 her speech#e60 to articulate#e61 a forward-looking vision for NATO, which will celebrate#e62 its 50th anniversary in Washington next#t8 month#t8, and to defend#e63 NATO's potential involvement#e64 in Kosovo.

In the aftermath#e66 of the Cold War, she said#e65, NATO must be ready#e67 to face#e68 ``an aggressive regime, a rampaging faction, or a terrorist group. And we know#e70 that if, past is prologue, we face#e71 a future in which weapons will be#e72 more destructive at longer distances than ever before.''

The NATO summit#e73, she said#e74, would produce#e75 an initiative#e76 that ``responds#e77 to the grave threat posed#e78 by weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery.''

In Kosovo, where the Yugoslav leader, Slobodan Milosevic, is resisting#e79 the deployment#e80 of NATO-led troops, including 4,000 U.S. soldiers, Albright insisted#e81 that NATO was#e82 the best tool to enforce#e83 a peace settlement#e84.

``We must be#e93 clear in explaining#e86 that a settlement#e87 without NATO-led enforcement#e88 is#e89 not acceptable because only NATO has#e90 the credibility and capability to make#e91 it work#e92,'' she said#e94. ``And we must be#e95 resolute in spelling#e96 out the consequences#e97 of intransigence,'' she added#e98, referring#e99 to the threat of NATO air strikes#e100 against Milosevic if he does not agree#e101 to the deployment#e102.

But in many ways, the day belonged#e103 to the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland, who in order to meet#e104 NATO's standards have had#e107 to cut#e105 the size of their Soviet-style militaries, organize#e106 civilian control of their armies and agree#e108 to buy#e109 NATO compatible equipment in#s9 the coming#t9 years#t9.

It was the spiritual homecoming#e110 to the West that all three foreign ministers stressed#e111.

``Poland forever returns#e112 where she has always belonged#e113 _ the free world,'' said#e114 Bronislaw Geremek, the foreign minister of Poland, who was#e115 a dissident during#s10 the Communist era#e116.

Geremek said#e117 he had brought#e118 some appropriate mementoes from Poland to the Truman library, including a campaign poster from 1989#t10 when the anti-communist Solidarity forces won#e119 against the Communists. The poster showed#e120 a picture of Gary Cooper from the film ``High Noon.''

``It helped#e121 us to win#e122,'' Geremek said#e220. ``For the people of Poland, high noon comes#e123 today#t11.''

The Czech foreign minister, Jan Kavan, who lived#e124 in London from#s11 1968#t12, when the Soviets invaded#e125 Czechoslovakia, until#s12 1989#t13, said#e126 he had remained#e127 buoyant during#s13 his opposition work#e128 as an emigre by believing#e129 that communism would eventually fall#e130. But he never dreamed#e131, he said#e132, that his country would become#e133 a member of NATO.

``Accession#e134 to NATO is a guarantee#e135 that we will never again become#e136 powerless victims of any foreign aggression,'' Kavan said#e138.

Similarly, the Hungarian foreign minister, Janos Martonyi, who remembers#e139 the 1956#t14 uprising#e140 as a 13-year-old, said#e141 that membership of NATO meant#e142 that Hungary was returning#e143 ``to her natural habitat.''

``It has been#e144 our manifest destiny to rejoin#e145 those with whom we share#e146 the same values, interests and goals,'' he said#e147.

But Martonyi also emphasized#e148 that Hungary understood#e149 NATO membership carried#e150 with it obligations as well as privileges. ``We shall prove#e151 that new members can indeed add#e152 to the weight of the alliance,'' he said#e153.

The location for Friday's#t15 ceremony#e154 was chosen#e155 by Albright, who as secretary of state is#e156 the depository of NATO's accession accords.

The secretary made the fairly unorthodox decision#e157 to choose#e158 a site outside Washington because she wanted#e159 the ceremony#e160 to resonate#e161 with the memories of President Truman, under whom NATO was founded#e162. On#s14 April#t16 4,#t16 1949#t16, on behalf of the United States, Truman's secretary of state, Dean Acheson, signed#e163 the Washington Treaty, which created#e164 NATO. Acheson is Albright's favorite predecessor, her aides said#e165.

Formed#e166 in reaction to the threat of the Soviet Union under Stalin, NATO calls#e167 for the collective defense#e168 of its members and was brought#e169 into being with an original 12 members.

The alliance has expanded#e170 three times before, adding#e171 Greece and Turkey in#s15 1952#t17, West Germany in#s16 1955#t18 and Spain in#s17 1982#t19. But never before has NATO reached#e172 out to its former Eastern-bloc enemies.

The Clinton administration embarked#e173 on the expansion#e174 of NATO in#s18 1993#t20 after#s19 Clinton met#e175 in Washington with President Havel and Lech Walesa, who was#e176 then the president of Poland.

These conversations#e177 are remembered#e178 by Clinton's foreign policy team because they took#e179 place after#s20 the opening#e180 of the Holocaust Museum and because they involved#e181 two very different Central European leaders who brought#e182 the same message.

Their message#e221 was that NATO should be used#e183 as the mechanism to secure#e184 the democratic progress of their countries and at the same dissuade#e185 Russia from any more imperial designs.

The U.S. ambassador to Poland, Dan Fried, who was#e187 then on the National Security Council, said#e186 Friday#t25 that he remembered#e188 being asked#e189 to help#e190 ``turn#e191 this pious wish into a policy.''

In#s21 July#t21 1997#t21, at a summit#e192 in Madrid, Spain, the alliance announced#e193 it would accept#e194 Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic. Romania and Slovenia, which had tried#e195 hard to meet#e196 the standards, were turned#e197 away, at least for the time being.

One problem was how to deal#e198 with the Russians, who vacillated#e199 between outright hostility and accepting what looked#e200 like the inevitable. In#s22 early 1997#t22, President Boris Yeltsin told#e202 President Clinton he could live#e203 with NATO expansion#e204. But in order to accommodate the Russians, NATO created#e205 the NATO-Russia Council as a consultative body that formalized#e206 relations between Moscow and the alliance.

Poland has been#e207 sensitive to the reactions#e208 of Russia to its membership of NATO, and Geremek has gone#e209 out of his way to reassure#e210 the Russians. ``We want#e211 our membership of NATO to serve#e212 as a `catalyst' for Polish Russian co-operation,'' he said#e213 last#t23 year#t23.

Even so, on the secretary of state's plane carrying Albright and the three foreign ministers to the ceremony#e214 Friday#t24, the ministers were asked#e215 whether they could ever foresee#e216 Russia as a member of NATO.

There was a long pause#e217 among the three ministers. Then Martonyi replied#e218: ``Silence#e219 is your answer.''
