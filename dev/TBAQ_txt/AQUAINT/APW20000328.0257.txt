Cuba Fears Elian Move Outside US



HAVANA (AP) --

President Fidel Castro said#e1 Tuesday#t1 his government told#e2 U.S. officials it is worried that Miami-based exiles might take#e5 Elian Gonzalez to another country or even harm#e6 him if they lose#e7 their battle#e26 to block#e8 the boy's return#e27 to Cuba.

Reading from Cuban intelligence documents on state television, Castro said#e9 a group of Cuban-Americans in Miami was studying#e10 the possibility of taking#e11 Elian and his Miami relatives to a third nation, probably Nicaragua or Costa Rica.

Castro said#e12 his government had shared#e13 its concerns with the U.S. State Department about the possibility of such a move#e31 ''which could cause#e14 damage not only to a child, but to the reputation of the United States.''

A State Department duty officer said#e15 she had no information on a threat#e34 to Elian and was unaware of Castro's remarks.

In Miami, the boy's great-uncle, Lazaro Gonzalez, denied#e16 that he would send#e17 Elian out of the country, or that he himself would leave#e18. ''It never even entered#e19 my mind,'' he said#e20. ''This is my home.''

The Cuban leader first raised#e21 those worries during another live television appearance#e37 Sunday#t2 night#t2 during a speech#e38 to about 700 Cuban university students.

But it was not until Tuesday#t3 that Castro revealed#e23 that those concerns had been shared#e24 directly with the U.S. government.
