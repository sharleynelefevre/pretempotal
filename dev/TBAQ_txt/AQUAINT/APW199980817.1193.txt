DAR ES SALAAM, Tanzania (AP) _

U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright headed#e1 Tuesday#t1 to East Africa, seeking#e2 to demonstrate#e3 American support after#s2 the bombings#e59 that targeted#e4 U.S. embassies, but mostly claimed#e5 African lives.

``To America's embassy personnel in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam, I will bring#e6 a message of solidarity in their sorrow, admiration for their courage and support for their continued#e7 efforts#e64 on behalf of our country,'' Albright said#e8 Monday#t2 before#s5 leaving#e9 Andrews Air Force Base, Maryland . ``To the people of Kenya and Tanzania, I will bring#e10 a message of friendship, made deeper by our shared grief, and of support in doing#e13 all we can to ease#e14 their suffering#e68 and help#e15 them start#e16 anew.''

Albright, after#s3 a 16-hour#t11 flight#e69, is scheduled#e17 to spend#e18 only five#t12 hours#t12 on the ground in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, her first stop#e70 Tuesday#t3 morning#t3, and then about 5#t13 1/2#t13 hours#t13 in Nairobi, Kenya, later in the day before#s1 returning#e19 immediately home.

Albright's visit#e71 to East Africa was designed#e20 in part to demonstrate#e21 U.S. resolve in the face of growing terrorist threats#e104 to Americans.

Some Kenyans have complained#e103 that after#s4 the Nairobi bombing#e74, rescuers gave#e24 priority to finding#e25 American victims and to protecting#e26 evidence at the expense of saving#e27 African lives. But Albright and other U.S. officials have strongly disputed#e28 that notion, saying#e29 the priority had been rescuing#e30 all possible, African and American.

On Friday#t5, when Albright set#e31 aside vacation#e77 plans for the hastily planned trip#e79 to East Africa, the State Department lifted#e33 a warning against travel to Kenya, whose economy relies heavily on foreign visitors, to further ease#e35 any strain in the aftermath of the tragedy#e84.

Just ahead of Albright's one-day#t14 trip#e85, the State Department on Sunday#t6 issued#e36 an updated ``worldwide caution'' to U.S. travelers in the aftermath of the Aug.#t7 7#t7 bombings#e88 at American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania and because of fresh threats#e89 to U.S. interests abroad.

An accompanying statement specifically warned#e39 ``against all travel to Pakistan.'' The State Department also ordered#e40 the departure#e92 of all non-emergency personnel and families of employees from the embassy at Islamabad and from U.S. consulates in Karachi, Lahore and Peshawar.

The warnings came#e41 after Pakistan handed#e42 over to Kenyan officials a suspect in the U.S. Embassy bombings#e95, Mohammed Saddiq Odeh, also known as Mohammad Sadiq Howaida and Abdull Bast Awadh.

The first batch of evidence from the Nairobi bombing#e96 arrived#e44 over the#t8 weekend#t8 at the FBI lab at the bureau's Washington headquarters and is being analyzed#e45, FBI officials said#e46 Monday#t9.

Many more shipments are expected#e47, but the first batch contained#e48 cotton swabs taken#e49 at the blast#e99 site in hopes of picking#e50 up microscopic residues that could positively identify#e51 what the bomb was made of. A U.S. official said#e53 last#t10 week#t10 that field tests suggested#e54 the presence of a Czech-made plastic explosive called Semtex that has been used#e57 by terrorist groups before.
