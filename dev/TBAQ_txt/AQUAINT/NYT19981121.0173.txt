MAN QUESTIONED IN KILLING OF BUFFALO DOCTOR IS RELEASED

The FBI has interviewed#e1 and released#e2 one of two men who were sought#e3 last#t2 week#t2 for questioning#e4 in connection with the sniper slaying#e5 of a doctor in the Buffalo, N.Y., area who performed#e6 abortions.

The two men, Ronald Stauber and Michael Gingrich, were named#e7 Thursday#t3 in a bulletin sent#e8 by the FBI office in Cleveland to police departments across the country. The men were not termed#e9 suspects, and FBI officials on#s1 Saturday#t4 played#e10 down the likelihood that either was involved#e11 in the Oct.#t5 23#t5 killing#e12 of the doctor, Barnett Slepian.

``We are doing#e13 dozens if not hundreds of interviews#e14 a day#t6,'' said#e15 Paul Moskal, a spokesman for the FBI office in Buffalo. ``I know#e16 of no information that would treat#e17 these two differently or would put#e18 them in any other category from the hundreds of leads we're investigating#e19 on#s2 a daily#t7 basis.''

Moskal said#e20 one of the two men _ he said#e21 he did not know#e22 which one _ had been located#e23, interviewed#e24 and released#e25. In its Friday#t8 issue, The Hamilton (Ontario) Spectator quoted#e26 an officer in the Amherst, N.Y., Police Department as saying#e27 that the FBI. bulletin had indicated#e28 possible links#e29 between the two men and James Charles Kopp, an abortion opponent who is being sought#e30 as a material witness in the case. Amherst police officials declined#e31 to comment#e32 Saturday#t9.

Slepian, 52, an obstetrician and gynecologist, was shot#e33 through the kitchen window of his home in Amherst shortly after#s3 he and his wife returned#e34 home from synagogue on#s4 the night of Friday,#t10 Oct.#t10 23#t10. He was#e35 one of three doctors who performed#e36 abortions in the Buffalo area. Investigators in Canada and the United States are also looking#e37 into four other sniper attacks#e38 on doctors who performed#e39 abortions in Canada and western New York.

Moskal said#e40 the two men apparently showed#e41 up at Slepian's house the day#t11 after#s5 his death#e42. They were trying#e43 to attend#e44 a prayer vigil for Slepian but had been sent#e45 to his house by mistake, and a police officer on duty took#e46 their names, Moskal said#e47. ``They were being sought#e48 for interviews#e49 just because they were#e50 literally in the area after#s6 the homicide#e51,'' he said#e52.

FBI officials said#e53 they were#e54 not certain whether Stauber or Gingrich had been involved#e55 in antiabortion activities. The two men are believed#e56 to live#e57 in the Cleveland area.

Inspector Keith MacCaskill of the Winnipeg Police Service, a Canadian member of a law-enforcement task force investigating#e58 all five of the shootings#e59, said#e60 he had never heard#e61 of the men.

Moskal emphasized#e62 that no one has been named#e63 as a suspect in Slepian's death#e64. ``Just the fact that we are interviewing#e65 anyone doesn't make#e66 them a subject or a suspect in this,'' he said#e67.
