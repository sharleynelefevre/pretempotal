MIAMI _

With a tense Miami waiting#e1, federal immigration officials said#e2 Monday#t1 they will order#e3 the Miami relatives of 6-year-old Cuban rafter Elian Gonzalez to turn#e4 the boy over to his father , who could come#e5 to the U.S. from Cuba as early as Tuesday#t2.

``Our goal is to reunite#e141 Elian and his father,'' said#e6 Maria Cardona, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service. ``The issue is not whether we will transfer#e7 Elian to his father, but when and how.''

Late Monday#t3, U.S. State Department officials said#e8 that travel visas had been approved#e9 for Elian's father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, his immediate family and three other people _ a pediatrician, a psychologist and one of Elian's favorite cousins. The group might come#e10 to the U.S. as soon as Tuesday#t4, according to unconfirmed media reports.

But Miami's volatile Cuban exiles continued#e12 to vow#e142 they would block#e13 any attempt#e110 to take#e14 Elian from the Little Havana home where he has been living with his Miami relatives, with some predicting#e16 bloodshed if federal agents come#e18 for the boy.

``There will be thousands here to stop#e19 it if they come#e20 for him,'' said#e21 Ana Bonnin, one of about 100 exiles who practiced#e22 forming#e23 a human chain outside the home Monday#t5. ``We'll try#e24 to do#e25 it peacefully, but you can only do#e26 so much. You can't control#e27 everybody.''

Late in the day, lawyers for Elian's Miami family emerged#e28 from their third day-long#t17 meeting#e112 with federal officials, but said#e29 little.

``We continue#e30 to be very concerned about the mental and psychological well-being of this 6-year-old,'' said#e31 Manny Diaz, one of the family's attorneys. ``To that end, we'll be back tomorrow#t6 to continue#e32 our negotiations#e114.''

Federal officials made no immediate comment.

It was not clear whether the Gonzalez family would come#e34 to Miami to get#e35 Elian or if instead they would travel#e36 to Washington, D.C.

Cuban President Fidel Castro has said#e37 they would live#e38 in the home of a Cuban diplomat in the Washington area until the court case surrounding Elian's fate is resolved#e39.

Visas for the entourage of more than 20 teachers, classmates and others _ including Ricardo Alarcon, Cuban National Assembly president _ that Castro wants#e41 to accompany#e42 the family were not yet approved#e43, officials said#e44.

The rush of events caps a four-month#t18 ordeal#e119 that has seen Elian catapulted#e143 into the center an international tug-of-war. He was found#e45 floating#e46 in an inner-tube off the Florida coast on#s1 Thanksgiving#t7 Day#t7 after#s2 a boat carrying#e47 him from Cuba sank#e48. His mother and 10 other people drowned#e144.

Federal officials placed#e49 him with his Miami relatives, but kept#e50 custody over him. In#s3 January#t8, Immigration and Naturalization Service Commissioner Doris Meissner ruled#e51 that Elian should go#e52 back to Cuba, a decision#e125 upheld#e53 by U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno.

The Miami relatives filed#e54 a federal lawsuit to overturn#e55 the decision#e127, but in#s4 March#t9 a Miami federal judge ruled#e56 against them. They immediately appealed#e57 to the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta.

Legal experts and federal officials maintain#e58 that Reno can allow#e59 the boy to be sent#e60 back to Cuba before#s5 the appeal#e128 is heard#e61.

Last#t10 week#t10, federal officials sought#e62 to have the family must sign#e63 an agreement to turn#e64 the boy over voluntarily should they lose#e65 their appeal#e130. If the family refused#e66, INS had threatened#e67 to revoke#e68 Elian's parole, meaning federal officials would take#e70 him from the Miami family.

The family refused#e71 to sign#e72 the agreement#e132 through two#t11 days#t11 of negotiations, and INS extended#e73 its deadline until 9#t20 a.m.#t20 EST#t20 Tuesday#t20.

The terms of the talks#e134 changed#e74 dramatically, however, when Castro announced#e75 last#t13 Wednesday#t13 that the boy's father was ready to travel#e76 to the United States. Previously, Gonzalez had said#e77 he would never come#e78 here to get#e79 his son.

Over the#t21 weekend#t21, lawyers for the family raised#e80 accusations that Juan Miguel Gonzalez had mistreated#e81 his son in telephone conversations#e136, saying#e82 he had told#e83 the boy that his mother was alive and waiting#e84 for him in Cuba.

But by Monday#t15, federal officials hardened their negotiating#e137 stance, insisting#e86 the boy would be turned#e87 over to his father once the Cuban group arrives#e88 in the United States.

Moves to keep#e89 Elian in this country through federal legislation appear#e90 to be stymied#e91, as most lawmakers seem#e92 to agree#e93 the boy should go#e94 back to Cuba. A new ABC News-Washington Post opinion poll shows#e95 that 6 of 10 Americans also believe#e96 the boy should go#e97 home with his father.

But in Miami, Cuban exiles insist#e98 the majority of Americans don't understand#e100 the dynamics of life in Cuba. Just how far they are willing to go#e101 to prove#e102 their point remains to be seen#e146.

``If he goes#e103 back, he won't be with his real father,'' said#e104 Elias Hernandez, who joined#e105 the crowd outside the Little Havana home of Elian's Miami relatives. ``His father will be Fidel Castro, the worst dictator in history.''
