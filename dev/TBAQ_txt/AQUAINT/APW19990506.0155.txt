Abortion Foe Charged in Slaying



BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) --

An abortion foe who is#e1 the subject of an international manhunt#e2 was charged#e3 with murder Thursday#t2 in the slaying#e4 of a doctor who was cut#e5 down in his kitchen by a sniper's bullet.

Federal and state arrest warrants were issued#e6 for James C. Kopp, 44, of St. Albans, Vt. His whereabouts are#e7 unknown.

``We have#e8 probable cause to believe#e9 this man, James Kopp, is responsible#e12 for the death#e11 of Dr. Barnett Slepian,'' FBI agent Bernard Tolbert said#e13.

Investigators have been searching#e14 for Kopp since#s1 shortly after#s2 the Oct.#t3 23#t3 slaying#e15. Up until#s3 Thursday#t4, however, they had described#e16 him only as a material witness wanted#e17 for questioning#e18 -- not a suspect.

In addition to a state charge of murder, Kopp faces#e20 a federal charge of violating#e22 the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act by using#e23 deadly force#e24 against an abortion doctor. Both charges carry#e25 up to life in prison. The federal charge also carries#e26 a fine of up to $250,000.

The newly filed charges will intensify#e27 the ongoing international manhunt#e28, Tolbert said#e29.

In response to the new charges, Canadian officials confirmed#e30 that Kopp is#e31 a suspect in sniper shootings#e32 that injured#e82 abortion doctors in#s4 November#t5 in Vancouver, British Columbia; Winnipeg, Manitoba; and Hamilton, Ontario.

Investigators would not divulge#e33 the evidence#e34 against Kopp but said#e35 last month's discovery#e36 of a scope-equipped rifle buried#e37 near the Slepian home represented#e38 a major breakthrough#e39. Slepian, 52, was shot#e40 with a rifle.

Authorities have said#e41 they believe#e42 the weapon may have been buried#e43 in#s5 advance#s5 of#s5 the shooting#e44, with the killer digging#e45 it up to fire#e46 the shot, then reburying#e47 it and fleeing#e48.

Kopp also has been linked#e49, through DNA testing, to a strand of hair found#e50 near where the sniper fired#e51, law enforcement sources have said#e52.

Nicknamed#e53 the ``Atomic Dog'' in anti-abortion circles, Kopp had been arrested#e54 in several states since#s6 1990#t6 for protesting#e55 abortion. His car was spotted#e56 in Slepian's suburban Amherst neighborhood in#s7 the weeks#t7 before#s8 the shooting#e57, and was found#e58 abandoned#e59 at New Jersey's Newark International Airport in#s9 December#t8, investigators said#e60.

Kopp's stepmother, who married#e61 Kopp's father when Kopp was#e62 in his 30s, said#e63 Thursday#t9 from her home in Irving, Texas: ``I would like#e64 to see#e65 him come#e66 forward and clear#e67 his name if he's not guilty, and if he's guilty, to contact#e68 a priest and make#e69 his amends with society, face#e70 what he did#e71.''

Kopp is#e72 now the second anti-abortion activist being sought#e73 by the FBI as a suspect in a fatal attack#e74.

Eric Rudolph has been#e75 on the run since#s10 the January#t10 1998#t10 bombing#e76 of a Birmingham, Ala., abortion clinic that killed#e77 an off-duty police officer and maimed#e78 a nurse. He also is charged#e79 in three Atlanta attacks, including the 1996#t11 Olympic bombing#e80 that killed#e81 one person.
