NAIROBI, August#t111 21#t111 (Xinhua) --

Director of the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Louis Freeh said#e1 here Friday#t2 that U.S. air raid#e45 on Afghanistan and Sudan is not directly linked#e2 with the probe#e46 into the August#t3 7#t3 bombings#e47 in east Africa.

"This is an investigation proceeding#e3 on many fronts," said#e4 Freeh at a press conference#e50 at the Jomo Kenyatta airport before#s1 returning#e5 home. "I cannot detail#e78 or characterize#e6 the type of evidence we have gathered#e7 in Nairobi."

He said#e8 he cannot confirm#e9 there is any evidence linking#e10 the bomb blasts#e51 at the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania to the Saudi millionaire and the allegedly main sponsor of anti-U.S. terrorism, Osama Bin Laden, who now#t4 lives in Afghanistan.

"Hundreds of people have been interviewed#e12" and investigators probably have to take#e13 quite a long time to compile#e14 evidence in the two bomb blasts#e54 so as to reach#e15 any conclusion, he said#e16. Freeh flew#e17 to Washington immediately after the press conference#e57.

U.S. President Bill Clinton said#e18 Thursday#t5 that he had ordered#e19 the strikes#e58 after#s3 receiving#e20 "convincing evidence" that the terrorist facilities the U.S. raided#e21 in Sudan and Afghanistan had played#e22 key roles in the bomb attacks#e60 in capitals of Kenya and Tanzania.

However, Freeh said#e23 although the bombing#e61 investigators from the FBI, Kenya and Tanzania have been working#e24 very hard and made "very good progress" on the case, so far no conclusion#e64 or decision#e65 can be made at this stage.

After touring#e66 Tanzanian capital Dar es Salaam Thursday#t6 and meeting#e67 with Kenyan police leaders Friday#t7 morning#t7, the FBI chief also said#e27 that he is very satisfied with the close and effective cooperation#e68 among the FBI agents and the police in Kenya and Tanzania.

The man who hurled#e28 a grenade at security guards at the U.S. embassy here seconds before#s2 the bomb exploded#e29 was positively identified#e30 Thursday#t8 as two more suspects -- one Arab, one Sudanese -- who had been arrested#e31, Kenya's national newspapers reported#e32 Friday#t9.

Local sources said#e33 that the plan of bombing#e71 U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania took three#t10 months#t10 to complete#e79 and bombers destined for Kenya were dispatched#e35 through Somalia and Rwanda.

A senior government official who saw#e36 the confessions#e72 of suspects was quoted#e37 Friday#t11 by local media as saying#e38 that an Egyptian Islamic Jihad group, linked#e39 with Laden, planned#e40 the attacks#e73.

The car bomb attack#e74 at the U.S. embassy in Nairobi killed#e41 253 people and injured#e80 5,000 others.

A nearly simultaneous car bombing#e75 outside the U.S. embassy in Tanzania killed#e42 10 people and wounded#e43 about 70 others.

Earlier, the U.S.'s demand#e76 for Laden's extradition#e77 from Afghanistan has been refused#e44 by the Taliban government.
