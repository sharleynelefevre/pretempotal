New Zealand expresses understanding over U.S. missile attacks



WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) _

The United States had the right to defend#e1 its citizens against terrorist actions#e14, New Zealand said#e2 Friday#t1 in response to U.S. missile attacks#e16 on alleged terrorist sites in Sudan and Afghanistan.

Foreign Minister Don McKinnon said#e3 that terrorist bombings#e17 this#t2 month#t2 of U.S. embassies in Nairobi, Kenya and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, ``show#e18 that terrorism is an indiscriminate killer of innocent people.''

Retaliating#e29 13 days after the deadly embassy bombings#e20 in East Africa, U.S. forces Thursday#t3 launched#e4 cruise missile strikes#e22 against alleged terrorist camps in Afghanistan and a chemical plant in Sudan.

``Countries have the right to defend#e5 themselves and their citizens against terrorism and New Zealand appreciates#e6 and understands#e7 the steps the United States has taken#e8,'' McKinnon said#e9.

The embassy bombings#e26, on Aug.#t4 7#t4, killed#e10 247 people in Kenya and 10 in Tanzania. More than 5,500 people were injured#e30, mostly Kenyans.

McKinnon's spokeswoman said#e11 the United States had ``very good intelligence'' linking the sites struck#e13 overnight with the embassy attacks#e28.
