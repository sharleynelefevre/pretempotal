international  Arrest Made in US Embassy Bombings



CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) --

Another man has been arrested#e1 in connection with the bombings#e30 of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania last#t1 year#t1 that killed#e2 224 people, police said#e3 today#t2.

``I can confirm#e4 that an individual was arrested#e5 in connection with the embassy bombings#e32 and the FBI was involved#e6'' in making the arrest#e33, police spokesman Capt. Rod Beer said#e8.

Beer said#e9 he did not know#e10 where the man was being held or any more details. The arrest#e34 brought#e12 to nine the number of people in custody in connection with the bombings#e37.

U.S. authorities scheduled#e13 a news conference#e38 for later today#t3 in New York.

The Cape Argus newspaper reported#e14 today#t4 that a Tanzanian man was arrested#e15, and that authorities were searching#e16 for accomplices. The Argus quoted#e17 immigration official Jurie de Wet as saying#e18 the arrests#e40 stemmed#e19 from information about requests for asylum and temporary residence in Cape Town.

The U.S. Embassy in Pretoria had no comment.

Seventeen people have been indicted#e20 in the case. Eight of those are in custody, but the rest remained fugitives, including Saudi radical Osama bin Laden. It was not immediately known if the arrest#e45 announced#e24 today#t5 stemmed#e25 from the indictment#e46.

Bin Laden, who is accused#e26 of masterminding the attack#e47, is on the FBI's 10 Most Wanted List. A $5 million reward#e48 has been offered#e27 for his capture#e49.

The bombs went#e28 off almost simultaneously on#s1 Aug.#t6 7,#t6 1998#t6 at U.S. embassies in Nairobi, Kenya and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania.
