Cuban Mothers Seek Elian's Return

HAVANA (AP) --

The grandmother of Elian Gonzalez said#e1 she is willing to go#e2 to Miami to bring#e3 the six-year-old boy home to Cuba, while#s3 Fidel Castro's point man on U.S. relations expressed#e4 impatience at Washington's failure#e80 to enforce#e5 a repatriation#e81 order.

In a massive demonstration#e83 demanding#e6 Elian's return#e84, tens of thousands of Cuban women -- hundreds visibly pregnant and others carrying#e7 small children -- marched#e8 along Havana's seaside boulevard on#s1 Friday#t1 to the U.S. mission, waving#e9 Cuban flags and chanting#e10 ``Bring#e124 back our son!''

Elian's young stepmother, Nelsy, flanked by his two grandmothers, was at the head of the ``March#e125 of the Combatant Mothers,'' pushing#e11 his half-brother in a stroller. Cuban authorities estimated#e12 that 100,000 women participated#e13 in the march#e126.

The protest#e86 marked#e14 a return to the larger demonstrations#e88 of early#t3 December#t3, when hundreds of thousands of people rallied#e15 in some of Cuba's biggest gatherings since the triumph#e90 of the revolution#e91 that brought#e16 President Castro to power 41#t4 years#t4 ago#t4.

Elian, the boy at the center of the international dispute#e92, was found#e17 clinging#e18 to an inner tube Nov.#t5 25#t5 off the coast of Florida after his mother, stepfather and others died#e127 in a failed#e19 attempt#e94 to reach#e20 U.S. shores. He has been staying with relatives in Miami who do not want#e23 to send#e24 him back to Cuba.

The U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service had ruled#e25 that Elian must be returned#e26 to his father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, and set#e27 Friday#t6 as the deadline for his repatriation#e96 to Cuba.

But this#t7 week#t7, Attorney General Janet Reno lifted#e28 the deadline to give#e29 Elian's relatives in Miami a chance to fight#e30 in federal court to keep#e31 the boy with them.

Ricardo Alarcon, president of the National Assembly and Castro's point man on U.S.-Cuban relations, told#e32 The Associated Press that Cuban authorities are frustrated by Reno's failure#e98 to set#e34 a new deadline and the INS's failure#e99 to enforce#e35 its decision.

``No enforcement#e101 action#e102 was ever announced#e36 by the INS,'' he said#e37.

Alarcon, former Cuban ambassador to the United Nations, dismissed#e38 suggestions by some U.S. politicians and Elian's relatives in Miami that Elian's father travel#e104 from Cardenas, Cuba, to Miami to pick#e39 up the boy. He said#e40 Cuba has not prohibited#e41 Gonzalez from going#e42 to Miami to retrieve#e43 Elian, American attorneys -- and even American officials -- have counseled#e128 against it.

``We have gotten#e129 the same message from U.S. officials -- in private -- several times that it is not advisable for this man to appear#e44 in U.S. territory,'' said#e45 Alarcon.

The concern in Cuba always has been that if Gonzalez goes#e46 he will immediately become#e47 involved#e48 in political and legal problems that will prevent#e49 his speedy return#e107.

Elian's paternal grandmother, Mariela, told#e50 reporters that she was willing to go#e51 to Miami to retrieve#e52 her grandson if it was assured#e53 to her that she could pick#e54 him up and return#e108 immediately to Cuba without become#e55 embroiled#e56 in legal or political problems.

``I would go#e57 there just for one#t8 minute#t8 to get#e58 him. To get#e59 him. Nothing more,'' she said#e60.

Since his sea rescue#e109, Elian has been increasingly referred#e61 to in Cuba as ``our son,'' a boy hero symbolizing the government's decades-long#t10 ideological battle#e111 with Cuban exiles in Miami. Rather than a clash#e113 between two governments, the dispute#e114 over Elian is a battle#e115 between Cubans of differing political views living on both sides of the Florida Straits.

Reno allowed#e65 the extension#e116 of the deadline after#s4 rejecting#e66 a Florida state court order that Elian remain in Miami until#s2 March#t9 6#t9 to hear#e68 arguments#e119 by his American relatives. Reno said#e69 the state court had no jurisdiction in the case, but that the Miami relatives should be able to make#e70 their case in federal court.

Elian's paternal great-uncle, Lazaro Gonzalez, is fighting#e71 to keep#e72 the boy with him in Miami, saying#e73 he can give#e74 the child a better life outside Cuba. He and others who oppose#e75 the boy's return#e122 to Cuba say#e76 that Elian's mother died to give#e77 the boy freedom in the United States.
