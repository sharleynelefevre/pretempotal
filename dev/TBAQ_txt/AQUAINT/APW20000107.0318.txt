Cuban Boy's Relatives File Petition



MIAMI (AP) --

In efforts to prevent#e1 Elian Gonzalez's return#e110 to Cuba, an anti-Castro lawmaker subpoenaed#e164 him Friday#t1 to testify#e165 before a congressional committee and one of his Miami relatives sought#e2 to become#e3 his legal guardian.

Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind., said#e4 he subpoenaed#e166 6-year-old Elian to testify#e167 before the Committee on Government Reform on#s1 Feb.#t2 10#t2, so he remains in the country while the courts consider#e6 his case.

About 100 supporters cheered#e7 wildly as Elian -- holding#e8 the subpoena in front of his face while being held#e9 aloft by a relative -- appeared#e10 outside the house where he has been staying with relatives. He gave#e12 the peace sign before#s2 heading#e13 back indoors.

But in Cuba, Elian's father was angry about Burton's subpoena.

``What right does that man have?'' Juan Miguel Gonzalez said#e14 during a news conference#e114 in his hometown of Cardenas. ``I am the father of Elian and immigration has said#e15 that I am the only one who can speak#e16 for him

``Why should it be delayed#e17? Who is he? He is no one. I am the father.''

Elian was found#e18 Thanksgiving#t3 Day#t3 clinging#e116 to an inner tube at sea after#s3 his mother, stepfather and eight other people drowned#e168 while trying#e19 to reach#e20 Florida by boat.

The boy was placed#e21 with his great-uncle and great-aunt in Miami, but the Immigration and Naturalization Service ruled#e22 Wednesday#t4 that he must be returned#e23 to his father in Cuba by#s4 Jan.#t5 14#t5. The decision#e118 touched#e24 off protests#e119 in the Cuban-American community.

Burton, the committee's chairman, said#e25 in a release he ``issued#e26 a subpoena to Elian Gonzalez to ensure#e27 that no precipitous action is taken#e28 until the Florida State court in Miami can adequately address#e29 the Gonzalez case.''

Burton is an outspoken critic of the Castro regime. A 1996#t20 law named#e30 for him and Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., strengthened#e31 the 1959#t21 trade embargo#e124 against Cuba.

Committee sources who spoke#e32 on the condition of anonymity said#e33 that while the subpoena requires#e34 that Elian attend#e35 the hearing#e125 in Washington, it's highly unlikely that his actual appearance will be sought#e36.

``The Congress of the United States is affording#e169 Elian Gonzalez what INS and this administration has not, which is his legal right and his right to due process,'' said#e37 Jorge Mas Santos, chairman of the Cuban American National Foundation. ``This gives#e38 him the protection that he will not be repatriated#e39 to Cuba between#s5 now#t6 and Feb.#t7 10#t7.''

Earlier Friday#t8, lawyers filed#e40 a petition on behalf of Elian's great-uncle, Lazaro Gonzalez. It is an attempt#e132 by his Miami relatives to get#e41 guardianship and then to file#e42 for applications for admission to the United States and asylum, said#e43 David Abraham, an immigration law professor at the University of Miami.

Neither the lawyers nor Elian's relatives would comment#e44 before#s6 the judge's ruling#e137, which is expected#e45 early#t9 next#t9 week#t9.

In Cuba, meanwhile, tens of thousands of people rallied#e46 in a seaside plaza Friday#t10 night#t10 to demand#e47 his return#e138. ``Elian, Cardenas awaits you ... with kisses,'' a Cuban country music band sang#e48.

Also Friday#t11, Miami-Dade Mayor Alex Penelas and Miami Mayor Joe Carollo, accompanied#e49 by one of the family's lawyers, flew#e50 to Washington to appeal#e51 directly to Attorney General Janet Reno. Gov. Jeb Bush also asked#e52 President Clinton to reverse#e53 the INS order.

Reno said#e54 she is considering#e55 the issues raised#e56 in the meeting#e141 and the state court action.

``I plan to respond#e58 as quickly as possible,'' she said#e59 in a statement.

Reno has said#e60 she was consulted#e61 on the INS decision#e145 and approved#e62 of it. Clinton said#e63 Friday#t12 the INS did the right thing.

``I believe#e64 they followed#e65 the law,'' Clinton said#e66. ``This is a volatile and difficult case. ... We need#e67 to keep#e68 this out of the political process as much as possible.''

In contrast to Thursday#t13, when two Cuban exile leaders and 133 other people were arrested#e69 and police were forced#e70 to use#e71 tear gas to disperse#e73 a crowd, protesters in Miami were much calmer Friday#t14.

However, the Cuban exile community called#e74 for more civil disobedience. About 100 protesters marched#e75 in front of the federal building in Orlando on#s7 Friday#t15 night#t15, waving#e76 Cuban and American flags and chanting#e77 ``Cuba libre'' and ``long live the USA.''

Two men carried#e79 a banner that said#e80 ``President Clinton, Please keep#e81 Elian in the United States.''

Protesters planned a large demonstration#e151 in Little Havana on#s8 Saturday#t16 and were planning to drive#e83 around Miami International Airport on Monday#t17.

``If the child is sent#e84 back to Cuba without his day in court, all hell is going to break#e86 loose,'' said#e87 Jose Basulto, founder of Brothers to the Rescue, an anti-Castro group.

The rally#e154 in Cardenas, Cuba, was marked#e88 by songs, tears and personal recollections of Elian. It was the most personal and emotional of many held since#s9 early#t18 December#t18, when Cuban President Fidel Castro promised#e90 mass mobilization#e158 until the boy was returned#e91 to his father.

Elian's father, his four grandparents and his great-grandmother began#e92 weeping#e93 as they sat in a row of chairs facing the stage as the group sang#e96 of the boy's mother. Gonzalez looked#e97 particularly distraught, his eyes red from crying#e98.

During the day Friday#t19, Elian played#e99 in his relatives' yard with a puppy named Dolphin, a gift from Rep. Lincoln Diaz-Balart, R-Fla. The black Labrador chased#e101 Elian around the yard and playfully nipped#e170 at his blue soccer shorts.

``Elian tells#e102 me he does not want#e103 to go#e104 back to Cuba,'' said#e105 Delfin Gonzalez, another of Elian's great-uncles. He said#e106 Elian wants#e107 his family to come#e108 here.
