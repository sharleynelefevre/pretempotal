U.S. ISSUING ARREST WARRANT FOR ABORTION FOE LINKED TO DOCTOR'S MURDER

Federal law enforcement officials said#e1 Wednesday#t2 that they had concluded#e2 that James Kopp, an impassioned and nomadic opponent of abortion, fired#e3 the shots that killed#e4 a Buffalo, N.Y., abortion-clinic doctor last October#t3.

Based on physical evidence _ including a rifle found#e5 in#s1 April#t4 month buried#e6 near the doctor's house and a match#e8 between fibers found#e7 near the murder and others found#e9 in Kopp's car _ officials said#e10 they had decided#e11 to issue#e12 a warrant for his arrest in the killing#e13 of Dr. Barnett Slepian.

Kopp, a fugitive, has until now been described#e14 only as a material witness and a nationwide warrant had been issued#e15 so that he could be held#e16 for questioning#e17.

There was#e18 no official confirmation of the decision#e19 to upgrade#e20 the warrant, but Denise O'Donnell, the U.S. attorney for the Western District of New York in Buffalo, has scheduled#e21 a news conference#e22 Thursday#t5 to announce#e23 a ``major development#e24'' in the Slepian murder investigation. Erie County District Attorney Frank Clark, Bernard Tolbert, the special FBI agent in charge of the Buffalo office, and other investigators will also be#e25 there.

Since there is#e26 no federal homicide statute as such, the federal officials said#e27 Kopp could be charged#e28 under the recent Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act, which provides#e29 for a sentence#e30 of up to life imprisonment for someone convicted#e31 of physical assaults#e32 or threats#e33 against abortion providers. If Kopp were also indicted#e34 and convicted#e35 on state murder charges, he could face#e36 the death penalty.

Slepian, a 52-year-old obstetrician and gynecologist who was#e37 the mainstay of Buffalo's only abortion clinic, was shot#e38 to death on#s2 the night of Oct.#t6 23#t6 as he stood#e39 in the kitchen of his home in suburban Amherst, N.Y. chatting#e40 with his wife and one of his four sons.

No weapon was recovered#e41 in the first police searches of the area around Slepian's home. But on#s3 April#t7 8#t7, investigators, wondering#e42 how the assailant could have emerged#e43 from the woods without fearing#e44 he would be seen#e45 carrying#e46 a rifle, searched#e47 the site of the shooting#e48 once more and unearthed#e49 a rifle buried#e50 one foot below ground 200 feet behind the Slepian home.

Clark, the Erie district attorney, said#e51 afterwards that investigators think#e52 the doctor's killer buried#e53 the rifle in#s4 the days#t8 before#s5 the shooting#e55, unearthed#e56 the weapon to fire#e57 the fatal shots, then hurriedly reburied#e58 it and fled#e59.

The 44-year-old Kopp, who in FBI photographs appears#e60 as gaunt and scruffily bearded and whose last known addresses were#e61 in Vermont and New Jersey, emerged#e62 as the focus of the investigation within#s6 two#t9 weeks#t9 of the slaying#e63. A jogger observed#e64 Kopp's car at#s7 6#t10 a.m#t10. near Slepian's home 10#t11 days#t11 before#s8 the murder#e65, and, curious#e66 why a stranger would be parked#e67 there so early, wrote#e68 down the license plate number.
