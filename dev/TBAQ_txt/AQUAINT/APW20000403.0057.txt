Castro: Elian's Dad May Come Monday  By ANITA SNOW, Associated Press Writer



HAVANA (AP) --

In an apparent bid to show#e1 flexibility in the campaign#e90 to return#e2 Elian Gonzalez to Cuba, President Fidel Castro said#e3 the boy's father has offered#e4 to travel#e5 alone today#t1 to the United States to pick#e6 up his 6-year-old son.

However, a group trip#e91 with the boy's relatives and classmates appeared#e7 more likely than a solo trip#e93 by his father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez.

Gonzalez, the boy's stepmother, his baby half-brother, a dozen classmates and some adults planned#e8 to apply#e124 for American visas today#t2 at the U.S. Interests Section in Havana, the American mission here. The group would be ready to leave#e9 for the United States as soon as Tuesday#t3, Castro said#e10.

Gonzalez said#e11 he would go#e12 get#e13 his son alone if U.S. authorities promised#e14 they would turn#e15 Elian over to him immediately and allow#e16 them to fly#e17 back to Cuba right away, Castro said#e18 Sunday#t4.

''I am willing to leave#e19 tomorrow#t5, absolutely alone and transport#e20 myself to where the child is,'' Castro read#e21 from a letter signed#e22 by Gonzalez.

''Only the government of the United States can decide if it prefers#e23 this variant,'' continued#e24 the letter, which Castro read#e25 on a state television station broadcast#e97.

Gonzalez for months refused#e26 requests#e98 by Elian's Miami relatives to go#e27 to the United States to claim#e28 the boy.

At the same time, the lawyers for the boy's relatives in Miami said#e29 they might try#e30 to argue#e31 that his father is an unfit parent.

The White House has said#e32 there is no evidence of unfitness, and the father's lawyer, Gregory Craig, said#e33 the ''outrageous'' allegations were a sign the Miami relatives were getting#e34 desperate.

It was unclear if American authorities would give#e35 the Cubans the 28 visas they have proposed#e36. The group would not leave#e37 until Gonzalez had assurances that American authorities would give#e38 him custody of his son.

The plan is for him and other members of the delegation to stay#e39 in Washington at the homes of Cuban diplomats while awaiting the results of a federal court appeal#e105 by Elian's Miami relatives, who have temporary custody of him and are seeking#e40 to block#e41 his return#e107 to Cuba.

In another dramatic move#e108, Castro announced#e42 that the chief of the Cuban Interests Section in Washington was willing to revoke#e43 the diplomatic immunity on his residence, where Cuba has proposed#e44 Gonzalez stay#e45 with Elian and the rest of his family during the federal appeal#e111 -- which could take#e46 as long as a#t6 month#t6 or two.

Castro said#e47 that if those who oppose#e48 returning#e49 Elian to Cuba are worried about turning#e50 the child over to ''what is considered#e51 Cuban territory, then our Interests Section is willing to renounce#e52 diplomatic immunity of the residence of the chief of this section in Washington.''

Elian has been at the center of an international tug-of-war since he was rescued#e53 off the coast of Florida in#s1 late#t7 November#t7. His mother was among 11 people who died#e125 after they boat sank#e54 during the attempted#e55 crossing#e56 from Cuba to the United States.

Elian's Miami relatives are fighting#e57 to keep#e58 the boy in the United States, saying#e59 they can give#e60 him a better life off the communist island. Gonzalez has demanded#e61 his rights as the child's sole surviving parent and wants#e63 Elian returned#e64 to him.

In its latest deadline, the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service has given#e65 the Miami relatives until 9#t8 a.m.#t8 Tuesday#t8 to sign#e66 a paper promising to turn#e67 over the boy to immigration authorities if they lose#e68 their federal court appeal#e119.

The Miami relatives thus far have refused#e69 to sign#e70 the document, and in recent days said#e71 they would not turn#e72 Elian over to his father if he came#e73 to the United States. Earlier, they had said#e74 they would give#e75 the boy to Gonzalez if he made#e76 the trip#e120.

Before his Sunday#t9 night#t9 address, Castro played#e77 the affectionate grandfather to the 12 first-graders proposed#e78 to go#e79 on the trip#e121, assuring#e80 them that their planned trip#e122 to Washington to retrieve#e82 their little friend was a very important mission#e123.

Patting some of the kids on the head, Castro assured#e83 them that they formed#e84 a powerful ''commando.''

''Not even the Pentagon can handle#e85 these kids,'' he joked#e86. ''We are hoping#e87 that they get#e88 their visas.''
