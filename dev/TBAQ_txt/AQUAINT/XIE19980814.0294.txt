Clinton Vows to Find Embassy Bombers



WASHINGTON, August 13 (Xinhua) --

President Bill Clinton Thursday#t2 condemned#e1 terrorist bomb attacks#e34 at U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania and vowed#e55 to find#e2 the bombers and bring#e3 them to justice.

"No matter what it takes, we must find#e5 those responsible for these evil acts#e35 and see#e6 that justice is done," Clinton said#e7 at the ceremony#e36 marking the return#e37 of remains of Americans who were killed#e9 in the Kenya embassy bombing#e38.

The ceremony#e39 was held#e10 at Andrews Air Force Base, near Washington, where 10 of 12 American victims of the Kenya embassy bombing#e40 were brought#e11 back by Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.

Clinton said#e12 the United States will not retreat#e13 from the world because of terrorist attacks#e41.

Albright, echoing#e14 the president, said#e15 the United States would "continue#e16 to be present around the world, wherever we have interests to defend#e17."

"We will do#e18 all we can to protect#e19 our diplomatic and military peoples around the world," she said#e20.

Clinton met#e21 with his top aides Wednesday#t3 in the White House to assess#e22 the situation following the twin bombings#e44 at U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, which have killed#e24 more than 250 people and injured#e54 over 5,000, most of them Kenyans and Tanzanians. Twelve Americans were killed#e25 in the Kenya embassy bombing#e45.

Clinton ordered#e26 an assessment of what it would cost to rebuild#e28 the embassies in Kenya and Tanzania and the price tag for emergency response teams sent#e29 to the two countries.

He also asked#e30 for a "list of the priorities for improving#e31 security for U.S. facilities around the world."

The State Department and the Office of Management and Budget will jointly make#e32 the assessments "in the next few days," and the president will present#e33 the report to Congress for more emergency funding.
