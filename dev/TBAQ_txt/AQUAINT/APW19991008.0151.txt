NEW YORK (AP) --

A man whose house was allegedly a bomb factory was arrested#e1 in connection with last#t1 year#t1's deadly U.S. Embassy blasts#e28 in Kenya and Tanzania and was brought#e2 to the United States for trial#e29.

The suspect -- Khalfan Khamis Mohamed -- was scheduled#e3 to appear#e4 before a U.S. magistrate judge in Manhattan at midday#t2, according to a statement today#t3 by U.S. Attorney Mary Jo White.

The latest arrest#e31 brought#e6 to nine the number of people in custody in connection with the bombings#e34.

White heads#e7 a team that is investigating#e8 and prosecuting#e9 the bombings#e35 which killed#e10 224 people, including 12 Americans, on#s1 Aug.#t4 7,#t4 1998#t4.

Mohamed, 24, allegedly rented#e12 a house in his native Tanzania which was used#e13 as a bomb factory.

In Cape Town, South Africa, police spokesman Capt. Rod Beer said#e14 the FBI arrested#e15 Mohamed at the city's airport in the early hours of Thursday#t5 morning#t5 as he was about to be deported#e16 for being in the country illegally.

The Cape Argus newspaper in Cape Town reported#e17 that a search#e36 has been launched#e18 for accomplices in the region.

The U.S. Embassy in Pretoria, South Africa, had no comment.

Seventeen people have been indicted#e19 in the case. Eight of them are in custody in the United States and one overseas.

The rest remained fugitives, including Saudi radical Osama bin Laden. Bin Laden is accused#e22 of masterminding#e44 the attack#e39, and is on the FBI's 10 Most Wanted List. A $5 million reward has been offered#e23 for his capture#e41.

The bombs went#e24 off almost simultaneously. The victims in Nairobi, Kenya, numbered 213, including 12 Americans. Eleven people, none of them Americans, died#e43 in the blast#e42 in Dar-es-Salaam, Tanzania.
