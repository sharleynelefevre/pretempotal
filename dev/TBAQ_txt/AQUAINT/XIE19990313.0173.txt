BUDAPEST, March#t111 12#t111 (Xinhua) --

Hungary's accession#e1 to NATO has brought#e2 about new changes to the political balance in central and eastern Europe, shattering#e3 the world configuration under the Yalta accord since#s1 World War#e4 II, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban said#e5 here Friday#t2.

Addressing#e6 a NATO flag-lowering ceremony#e7 at the Dutch embassy, Orban said#e8 the occasion#e37 indicated#e9 the end#e10 of the embassy's mission#e11 of liaison between Hungary and NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization).

The Hungarian government staged#e12 a number of celebrations#e13 to mark#e14 the country's entry#e15 into NATO on#s2 Friday#t3.

In a televised address#e16 Friday#t4, President Arpad Gencz described#e17 the entry#e18 as "a historic event#e19" which proves#e20 the credibility and the realistic approaches of the country's foreign policy.

Among the first three former Warsaw Pact countries to accede#e21 to NATO on#s3 Friday#t5 were#e22 also Poland and the Czech Republic.

The ambassadors of Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic issued#e23 a joint statement Friday#t6 saying#e24 the three countries' entry#e25 into NATO will consolidate#e26 Europe's security and help#e27 eliminate#e28 threats to it.

Five major political parties in the country issued#e29 statements supporting#e30 the country's NATO membership#e31.

But some other parties and social organizations are#e32 against NATO's expansion, claiming#e33 Hungary's accession#e34 to NATO would be#e35 detrimental to the country's independence and bring#e36 about new problems and economic burdens to the country.
