Internet Provider Closes Web Site



ATLANTA (AP) --

The creator of an anti-abortion Web site found#e1 to be a threat to abortion providers says#e2 a decision#e3 to shut#e4 the site down is just a ``temporary setback#e5.''

Neal Horsley said#e6 Friday#t2 that he would seek#e7 a new Internet service for his ``Nuremburg Files'' site, which was#e8 the focus of a federal court trial#e9 that led#e10 to a $107 million verdict#e11 this#t3 week#t3 in favor of abortion providers.

Horsley was#e12 not a defendant in the suit#e13, in which the Portland, Ore., jury ruled#e14 that such sites constitute#e15 threats to abortion providers.

MindSpring, which provided#e16 the Internet space for the site, closed#e17 it Thursday#t4 night for violating#e18 ``our appropriate use policies,'' spokesman Serge Clermont said#e19.

The Web site included#e20 the names and addresses of abortion doctors and featured#e21 photos#e22 of mangled fetuses and drawings#e23 of dripping blood.

Three times, doctors whose names appeared#e24 on the list were killed#e25, most recently last#t5 October#t5 when Dr. Barnett Slepian was gunned#e26 down by sniper fire in his home outside Buffalo, N.Y. His name on the Web site was crossed#e27 out that#t6 same#t6 day.#t6

Pathway Communications, which has maintained#e28 the site, said#e29 in a statement that ``The Nuremberg Files'' was knocked#e30 off-line without notice. The company said#e31 it was informed#e32 Friday#t7 that it violated#e33 MindSpring's policy on ``threatening and harassing language.''

Horsley called#e34 the move#e36 a ``temporary setback#e35.''

``We are presently searching#e37 for a bolder and more principled (Internet service provider) to host#e38 the Nuremburg Files,'' the statement said#e39.
