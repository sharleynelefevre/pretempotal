Clinton Vows to Hunt Down Embassy Bombers



WASHINGTON, August#t1 8#t1 (Xinhua) --

President Bill Clinton Saturday#t2 vowed#e40 to hunt#e23 down and bring#e1 to justice those who were responsible for the bombings#e24 of two U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.

"No matter how long it takes or where it takes us, we will pursue#e41 terrorists until the cases are solved#e4 and justice is done#e42," Clinton said#e5 in his weekly#t3 radio address.

"To turn#e6 our backs on those taking#e7 risks for peace, to weaken#e8 our opposition to terrorism -- that would give#e9 terrorism a victory it must not and will not have," the president said#e10.

The Friday#t4 explosions#e32 at U.S. embassies in Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar-es-Salaam, Tanzania, killed#e11 at least 110 people, and the number injured#e43 topped 2,200. The 11 Americans were killed#e12 in Kenya, along with five Kenyan employees at the embassy.

The State Department has sent#e13 medical and other supplies as well as investigators to the two countries. The FBI also dispatched#e14 dozens of agents and bombing#e35 and evidence specialists there.

Aircraft have taken#e15 off from the United States, Europe and elsewhere in Africa bearing#e16 medical suplies and other equipment, along with replacement personnel for the two embassies.

A 62-member rescue team, previously sent#e17 to the bombed-out federal building in Oklahoma City, Okla., was en route to Nairobi.

U.S. embassies and military installations around the world were ordered#e19 to set#e20 up barriers and tighten#e21 security systems to prevent#e22 easy access by unauthorized people -- Americans and foreigners.
