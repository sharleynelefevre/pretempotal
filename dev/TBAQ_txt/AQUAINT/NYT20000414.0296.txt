MIAMI _

The small pharmacy on Unity Boulevard in Little Havana is unassuming. No Cuban flags sway from its door and no political signs pushing#e2 for the case of young Elian Gonzalez hang from its windows.

But the opinion of the woman who runs the modest business, which sells everything from prescription drugs to chewing gum and toys, carries a lot of weight in this part of Miami.

She is Fidel Castro's younger sister, Juanita. While her brother is the personification of evil in this neighborhood where Cuban flags fly from beatup Buicks, Juanita Castro is a beloved and respected member of this community.

And while she maintains a distance between herself and the heated rhetoric and politics that envelop#e69 Miami, Friday#t1 she had definite opinions on the case of the 6-year-old Cuban boy that has dominated#e10 the city for almost five#t2 months#t2 now#t3.

``I feel for this child,'' Juanita Castro said#e12. ``This has become#e13 too politicized, in both Cuba and Miami, and too many people are profiting from this tragedy#e70. I think#e14 people have forgotten#e15 that this is a human issue.''

Juanita Castro, who arrived#e16 in Miami in#s1 1961#t4, believes#e17 the custody of the child should be worked#e18 out between his family members. She is not certain whether the boy should stay#e19 in the United States, but she feels that since he's been here so long, he should be afforded#e84 the opportunity to live#e21 in a free country.

When asked#e22 if she thought#e23 the boy's father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, was being controlled#e24 by the Cuban government even though he has been in Bethesda, Md., for the#t5 last#t5 week#t5, she frowned#e86.

``I don't know#e26 what Juan Miguel thinks#e27 or believes#e28,'' Juanita Castro said#e29. ``What I do#e30 think#e31 is that he should have arrived#e32 in this country at#t7 least#t7 72#t7 hours#t7 after his son was found#e33 floating#e34 off the coast of Fort Lauderdale.''

``This has gone#e35 too far. And it's now#t8 become#e36 a tragedy#e73.''

Dressed in a dark pink blazer and cream color pants, the sister of the Cuban dictator walked#e37 around the pharmacy talking#e38 warmly with her customers.

She said#e39 she she sometimes talks#e40 to family members back in Cuba. ``I have sisters that I still speak#e41 to,'' she said#e42, ``and this situation#e76 is driving people crazy.''

The only thing on Cuban television is Elian's story, she said#e44, and she feels the Cuban people are getting#e46 tired of the issue.

She does not speak#e47 to her brother and hasn't for several years. ``Nobody talks#e77 to Fidel, because he doesn't listen#e48,'' Juanita Castro said#e49. ``He talks#e50 and he decides#e85.''

Juanita Castro said#e51 she has not visited#e52 the Miami relatives of Elian Gonzalez and has no plans to do#e53 so. Although she supports#e54 the cause of Miami's Cubans in their struggle against her brother's government, she said#e55 she prefers#e56 to keep#e57 a low profile when it comes to politics.

``I just work#e59 in my pharmacy every#t9 day#t9 and I pray#e60 for a resolution#e82 in our country (Cuba) that is without violence#e83,'' she said#e61. ``And I also pray#e87 for this young boy every#t10 day#t10 because he needs#e62 help#e63. He's been through a lot.''
