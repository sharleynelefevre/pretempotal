 Abortion Foe Charged in Slaying



BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) --

Dr. Barnett Slepian, just back from synagogue, was heating#e1 soup in his kitchen last#t2 fall#t2 when he was gunned#e2 down with a single shot#e3 through a window.

Slepian's killer is#e4 still at large. But for the first time, authorities have named#e5 a suspect in the slaying#e6 -- anti-abortion activist James Kopp.

``Today#t3, I'm here to tell#e7 you we have#e8 our suspect,'' said#e9 Bernard Tolbert, special agent-in-charge of the FBI's Buffalo office.

Kopp, 44, of St. Albans, Vt., became#e10 the subject#e11 of an international manhunt#e12 in#s1 November#t4 when he was called#e13 a witness in the case. He was charged#e14 Thursday#t5 in state and federal complaints with second-degree murder and with violating#e15 the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act by using#e16 deadly force#e17 against an abortion doctor.

Both charges carry#e18 a penalty of up to life in prison. The federal charge also carries#e19 a fine of up to $250,000.

Kopp's whereabouts remain#e20 unknown. He was last seen#e21 Nov.#t6 3#t6, the day before#s2 authorities issued#e22 a material witness warrant in the Slepian shooting#e23 in the hope#e24 of questioning#e25 him. Until#s3 Thursday#t7, they had not called#e26 Kopp a suspect.

Investigators would not divulge#e27 the evidence#e28 against Kopp but said#e29 last#t8 month#t8's discovery#e30 of a scope-equipped rifle buried#e31 near the Slepian home represented#e32 a major breakthrough#e33. Slepian, 52, was shot#e34 with a rifle.

Kopp also has been linked#e35, through DNA testing, to a strand of hair found#e36 near where the sniper fired#e37, law enforcement sources have said#e38.

Nicknamed#e39 the ``Atomic Dog'' in anti-abortion circles, Kopp had been arrested#e40 in several states since#s4 1990#t9 for protesting#e41 abortion. His car was spotted#e42 in Slepian's neighborhood in#s5 the weeks#t10 before#s6 the shooting#e43, and was found#e44 abandoned#e45 at the Newark, N.J., airport in#s7 December#t11.

The filing#e46 of the charges has intensified#e47 interest#e48 in Kopp as a suspect in three non-fatal sniper attacks#e49 on Canadian abortion providers, and one near Rochester, N.Y., between#s8 1994#t12 and 1997#t13.

Kopp is#e50 now the second anti-abortion activist being sought#e51 by the FBI as a suspect in a fatal attack#e52.

Eric Rudolph has been#e53 on the run since#s9 the January#t14 1998#t14 bombing#e54 of a Birmingham, Ala., abortion clinic that killed#e55 an off-duty police officer and maimed#e56 a nurse. He also is charged#e57 in three Atlanta attacks#e58, including the 1996#t15 Olympic bombing#e59 that killed#e60 one person.
