Thousands Rally for Elian in Cuba



HAVANA (AP) --

Tens of thousands of people paid#e1 tribute to the men who launched#e2 the Cuban Revolution more#t2 than#t2 four#t2 decades#t2 ago#t2 in a rally#e35 Saturday#t3 demanding#e3 the return#e36 of Elian Gonzalez.

With the historic yacht Granma towering behind him, Raul Castro, younger brother of President Fidel Castro and head of Cuba's Revolutionary Armed Forces, likened#e4 the revolutionary battle#e38 to the fight#e39 for Elian, the 6-year-old boy at the center of an international custody battle#e41.

''Here, no one gives#e5 up!'' Castro declared#e6.

The demonstrators, wearing#e7 T-shirts with Elian's portrait, waved#e8 red, white and blue Cuban flags on the shore of the community of Niquero, where the Granma landed#e9 on#s1 Dec.#t4 2,#t4 1956#t4, with 82 armed men led#e10 by Fidel Castro.

In the years#t8 that followed#e11, the guerrilla fighters waged#e12 war on the troops of dictator Fulgencio Batista, declaring#e13 victory#e44 on#s2 Jan.#t5 1,#t5 1959#t5 when Batista fled#e14 the country.

Castro noted#e60 the importance that Cuba's younger generations have played#e15 in the communist government's battle#e46 to secure#e16 Elian's return#e47 from the United States, where the boy's Miami relatives are fighting#e17 for permanent custody.

As a father and the grandfather of eight children -- including a boy who just turned#e19 6, the same age as Elian -- Castro said#e20 he sympathized with the little boy's father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez.

Gonzalez has cited#e21 his rights as the child's sole surviving parent in his calls#e49 for his boy to be returned#e23 to him in communist Cuba. Elian's mother and 10 others perished#e61 when their boat sank#e24 off the coast of Florida in#s3 late#t6 November#t6 during a crossing#e25 from Cuba to the United States.

''Elian today#t7 is the symbol of our unity,'' Castro said#e26 to cheers.

''And our struggle will not end#e27 with the return#e54 of Elian,'' added Castro. He said#e28 the Cuban people would continue#e29 to protest#e30 American laws and policies aimed#e31 at Cuba, including a four-decade economic embargo and continued#e33 U.S. military presence at the Guantanamo Naval Station on the easternmost end of the island.
