 DNA Tests Link Slain Doctor Suspect



WASHINGTON (AP) --

Preliminary DNA tests link#e1 a missing anti-abortion activist to a strand of hair found#e2 near where a sniper shot#e3 and killed#e4 a Buffalo, N.Y., doctor who performed#e5 abortions, a law enforcement official said#e6 Friday#t2.

The first round of DNA tests on the hair at the FBI Laboratory here established#e7 a high probability it came#e8 from the same person as a hair found#e9 in a New Jersey home where James C. Kopp, a 44-year-old anti-abortion protester, lived#e10 last#t3 year#t3, the official said#e11.

The first DNA tests did not exclude#e12 a match between the two strands.

Kopp has eluded#e13 authorities since they obtained#e14 a warrant for him as a material witness in the Oct.#t4 23#t4 sniper shooting#e15 of Dr. Barnett Slepian, a 52-year-old obstetrician-gynecologist who performed#e16 abortions. The search#e17 for Kopp was recently extended#e18 to Mexico.

Meantime, FBI agents and Metropolitan Police officers assigned#e19 to a joint terrorism task force here scanned#e20 the crowd of anti-abortion protesters at the annual March#e21 for Life on Capitol Hill, because Kopp has been either a participant#e24 in or arrested#e23 at this march#e25 in#s1 each of the last#t5 three#t5 years#t5, according to another law enforcement official,

Both officials requested#e26 anonymity#e27.

The FBI is conducting#e28 further DNA tests of the hair found#e29 outside Dr. Slepian's home. This more extensive set of tests could enable#e30 officials to declare#e31 an absolute match#e32 between the two hair strands, the first law enforcement official said#e33.

``Ultimately, we would need#e34 to have#e35 a hair taken#e36 directly from Kopp himself to establish#e37 conclusively the hair from scene is#e39 his,'' the official added#e38.

The official said#e40 the hair was#e41 in a cap that authorities found#e42 very near the location from which the sniper is thought#e43 to have fired#e44 the rifle bullet that killed#e45 Slepian as he stood#e46 in the kitchen of his home in the Buffalo suburb of Amherst, N.Y.

But The Buffalo News reported#e47 Friday#t6 that the hair was#e48 in a packet, with at least two bullets, that was found#e49 buried#e50 in the ground more than 50 feet from a tree where police believe#e51 the sniper stood#e52 and fired#e53.

Last#t7 week#t7, FBI Director Louis Freeh, on an official visit#e54 to Mexico, asked#e55 Mexican authorities to join#e56 the hunt#e57 for Kopp, federal officials have said#e58.

They believe#e59 Kopp was driven#e60 to Mexico by a female friend after#s2 the shooting#e61, and have#e62 a trail of her credit card receipts leading#e63 to Mexico, the federal officials have said#e64.

In addition, a Customs Service videotape from a border crossing point shows#e65 the woman's car returning#e66 from Mexico, these officials said#e67.

Authorities obtained#e68 a material-witness arrest warrant for Kopp after#s3 they said#e69 Kopp's car was spotted#e70 in Amherst in#s4 the weeks#t8 before#s5 Slepian was killed#e71.

Kopp's 1987 Chevrolet Cavalier was discovered#e72 last#t9 month#t9 at Newark, N.J., International Airport, the FBI said#e73. The car had been#e74 in the long-term lot for#s6 about two#t11 weeks#t11, said#e75 Greg Trevor, a spokesman for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.
