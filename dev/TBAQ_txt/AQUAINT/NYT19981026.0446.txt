KILLING OF DOCTOR BECOMES A FACTOR IN POLITICAL RACES

The killing#e1 of Dr. Barnett Slepian, a gynecologist in Buffalo who performed#e2 abortions, has become#e3 a factor in at least two campaigns in New York, say#e4 political consultants and some campaign advisers.

In the race#e5 for attorney general, the Democratic candidate, Eliot Spitzer, who favors#e6 abortion rights, has moved#e7 quickly to make#e8 the anti-abortion position of his opponent, Attorney General Dennis Vacco, a central issue in the campaign.

And in the tight race#e9 for U.S. Senate, while the Democrat, Charles Schumer, another abortion-rights supporter, has not raised#e10 Slepian's death himself, his aides say#e11 it puts#e12 a new emphasis on the issue.

Slepian was shot#e13 in the back on#s1 Friday#t2 night as he stood#e14 in his kitchen. No suspects have been identified#e15. Even before#s2 the killing#e16, Schumer was tyring#e17 to draw#e18 more attention to the anti-abortion record of his opponent, Senator Alfonse D'Amato, a Republican who is also running#e19 on the Right to Life Party line.

In a New York Times/CBS News poll completed#e20 on#s3 Saturday#t3, 69 percent of those polled said#e21 they did not know#e22 D'Amato's position on abortion, and only 19 percent knew#e23 that he opposed#e24 abortion rights.

Now events are doing#e25 the work#e26 for Schumer. Slepian's death was#e27 among the first topics raised#e28 in Saturday#t4 night's debate#e29 between the two men, and it was instantly followed#e30 by a question to D'Amato on whether he opposed#e31 first-trimester abortions for adult women.

On#s4 Tuesday#t5, the National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League plans#e32 to hold#e33 a news conference#e34 to screen#e35 a television advertisement _ made#e36 last#t6 week#t6, before#s5 Slepian died#e37 _ featuring Emily Lyons, a nurse who was badly wounded#e38 earlier#t7 this#t7 year#t7 in the bombing#e39 of an abortion clinic in Alabama.

The advertisement, said#e40 Kelli Conlin, the executive director of the New York State affiliate of Naral, is intended#e41 to spotlight#e42 D'Amato's vote against the 1994#t8 Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act#e43, which Schumer sponsored#e44. The measure made#e45 it a Federal crime to attack#e46 or blockade#e47 an abortion clinic. Now, Ms. Conlin said#e48, it will have#e49 new resonance, and the organization is considering#e50 buying#e51 more air time.

``It's incredibly sincere and powerful and it would have been#e52 regardless,'' she said#e53. ``But sensitivities are#e54 so heightened from the shooting#e55 in western New York that it's even more powerful.''

David Eichenbaum, a Democratic political consultant who is not working#e56 for anyone in this year's campaign, said#e57 abortion ``is#e58 no longer the driving issue it once was#e59, at least on the pro-choice side.''

But, Eichenbaum said#e60: ``Sometimes an incident#e61 like this will do more to energize#e62 those who are pro-choice who otherwise might not consider#e63 that as an important an issue to go#e64 to the polls over. It brings#e65 it home.''

D'Amato's aides would not comment#e66 about the political ramifications of the slaying#e67, and Schumer's aides would not talk#e68 about whether they planned#e69 to refer#e70 to it in any advertisements, or whether the candidate planned#e71 to use#e72 it on the campaign trail.

``Both Senator D'Amato and Chuck Schumer agree#e73 this was#e74 a horrific crime and a horrible tragedy,'' said#e75 Josh Isay, Schumer's campaign manager.

But, Isay added#e76, ``it heightens#e77 the abortion issue.''

Steven Goldstein, the campaign spokesman for Spitzer, was#e78 less reticent. ``Eliot is going#e79 to make#e80 a huge priority of this,'' Goldstein said#e81. ``Stopping#e82 clinic violence#e83 is going#e84 to be#e85 a major theme of our campaign from now to#s9 Election#t9 Day#t9.''

In Sunday#t10's debate#e86 against Vacco, Spitzer attacked#e87 him for failing#e88 to enforce#e89 a court order#e90 in#s6 1992#t11 against anti-abortion protesters who had blocked#e91 the entrance to a clinic. It was#e92 the same clinic where Slepian worked#e93.

A federal judge removed#e94 Vacco, then the U.S. attorney for western New York, from the case. He was replaced#e95 with two special prosecutors. Spitzer also criticized#e96 Vacco for dismantling#e97 the Office of Reproductive Rights, which investigated#e98 threats and crimes against abortion clinics, when he became#e99 attorney general.

On#s7 Monday#t12, Spitzer called#e100 for Vacco to revive#e101 that unit immediately, vowing#e102 that he would do#e103 so on#s8 his first#t13 day#t13 in office if elected#e104.

Goldstein, who said#e105 it was#e106 ``thoroughly, thoroughly possible'' that the issue would surface#e107 in Spitzer's advertisements, defended#e108 the use of the issue by noting#e109 that the attorney general has#e110 direct impact on the issue of clinic access.

Vacco's campaign manager, Matt Behrmann, said#e111 in a statement that Spitzer had ``sunk#e113 to a new and despicable low by attempting#e114 to capitalize#e115 on the murder#e117 of a physician in order to garner#e116 votes.''

``It's possible that New York politics has never seen#e118 anything as crass as Eliot Spitzer's willingness#e119 to exploit#e120 the unfortunate murder#e121 of Slepian as a steppingstone for his own political ambitions,'' Berhrmann said#e122.

Several consultants agreed#e123 that there might be#e124 political hay to be made#e125 in Slepian's death but that it had#e126 to be done carefully.

``Trying#e127 to score#e128 political points from a homicide#e129 can have#e130 a backlash,'' said#e131 Maureen Connelly, a media consultant not working#e132 for any candidate in next#t14 week#t14's election#e133.
