MIAMI _

The angry crowd rushed#e1 at Manuel Gonzalez as he stepped#e2 out of Miami's federal courthouse, shaking#e3 fists at him and shouting#e190 in Spanish, ``communista'' and ``traitor.''

But the great-uncle of 6-year-old shipwreck#e131 survivor rafter Elian Gonzalez only ducked#e4 his head and walked#e5 faster.

In a drama that has divided#e191 his once close-knit family and may finally be resolved#e8 in a court hearing#e133 the#t2 week#t2 of#t2 March#t2 6#t2, Manuel Gonzalez, 59, a soft-spoken bus mechanic, has remained largely out of the glare of television lights.

Until this#t3 week#t3.

He was thrust#e11 into the middle of the swirling#e192 Gonzalez family saga when Elian's father, Juan Miguel, sent#e12 a letter to U.S. Attorney Janet Reno asking#e13 that his son be moved#e14 to Manuel Gonzalez's home.

Alone among his two brothers and two sisters who have fled#e15 Cuba for Miami, Manuel Gonzalez believes#e16 Elian should go#e17 back to Cuba to live#e18 with his father.

Reno denied#e19 the request#e135, but Manuel Gonzalez didn't back#e193 down.

In a town where expressing#e20 even the slightest approval for Cuban President Fidel Castro can prompt#e21 threats of physical harm, Manuel Gonzalez filed#e22 a motion in federal court asking#e23 for custody of Elian so that he could help#e24 reunite#e194 the boy with his father in Cuba.

It was a move that many see#e25 as courageous and principled, but others fear may be foolhardy.

``I have lost#e27 a son,'' Gonzalez told#e28 reporters later, referring#e29 to his own son's death#e142 due to cancer. ``I am supporting#e30 Juan Miguel because I know#e31 what it is to lose#e32 a son. Elian should be with his father.''

His sincerity didn't stop#e144 the talk on Little Havana's streets or on Miami's ubiquitous Spanish-language radio stations, which buzzed#e33 with callers lambasting#e195 Gonzalez for playing#e34 into the hands of a tyrant.

A day after he was hounded#e196 on the steps of the federal courthouse, Manuel Gonzalez wouldn't come#e35 to the door of his modest home in Miami's Little Havana.

``He must go#e36 to work#e37,'' said#e38 his daughter, Rosa, who said#e39 Gonzalez would prefer#e40 not to talk#e41 about the issue. ``There has been a lot of pressure, and he feels this is a family affair.''

After weeks of high-profile public sparring#e148 _ with charges of abuse#e150, spying#e43 and treachery#e151 flying#e44 back and forth across the Florida Straits _ it would seem#e45 the chances are slim that the Gonzalez family could ever heal#e197 the wounds created#e46 by the Elian saga.

But the family has overcome#e47 steep obstacles before. Long before Elian thrust#e153 them into the unrelenting glare of the international spotlight, the Gonzalez clan was a typical example of the conflicts#e155 and painful separations#e156 wrought#e48 by the Cuban revolution#e157.

Of the nine brothers and sisters of Manuel's generation, five have come#e49 to Miami, while three remain in Cuba and one has passed#e51 away.

According to press reports#e159, Caridad Gonzalez, the oldest sister, was the first to come#e53 to the United States, arriving#e54 in#s1 1966#t4. Her brother Delfin, who was imprisoned#e55 as an anti-Castro activist in#s6 the 1960s#t5, followed#e56 in#s2 1979#t6. Then came#e57 another sister, Georgina, in#s3 1983#t7, followed#e58 by Manuel and Lazaro in#s4 1984#t8.

Of those who stayed#e59 in Cuba, Juan Miguel's father, Juan Gonzalez, seems#e60 the most closely allied with the Cuban government. He worked#e61 as a police officer in a Cuban ministry, a position that probably helped#e62 his son _ Elian's father _ get#e63 a job in the Communist island's increasingly lucrative tourism industry.

The family's experience#e162 is like that of thousands of others now#t9 split between Miami and Cuba, said#e64 Damien Fernandez, a Cuban-American political scientist at Florida International University.

``Cubans value their families above almost anything, but the post-1959#t14 politics have managed#e65 to split#e66 thousands of families apart,'' he said#e67.

For decades, Cuban Americans in Miami were largely cut#e68 off from the families they left#e69 behind. Labeled ``worms'' and ``traitors'' by Castro, many weren't able to speak#e70 to _ much less visit#e165 _ their relatives for years#t15.

The situation began#e71 to relax#e72 in the early#t10 1990s#t10, with the crisis#e167 triggered#e73 by the end#e168 of the former Soviet Union's subsidies. In desperate need of hard currency, Castro relaxed#e74 travel restrictions and allowed#e75 Cubans to have U.S. dollars, triggering#e76 a trickle of cash from Miami that soon became#e78 a flood.

By some estimates, the 700,000 Cubans living in South Florida _ and elsewhere in the United States _ send#e80 $1 billion a#t11 year#t11 in remittances back to their families on the island.

``The Miami families have become#e81 a lifeline, and since#s5 1990#t12 there has been a great trend toward reconciliation#e175,'' said#e82 Florida International's Fernandez. ``Although many families are still divided by politics, they have learned#e83 to forgive#e84 and forget#e85 and find#e86 common ground.''

Prior to Elian, the Gonzalez family apparently was no different. The branches of the family regularly talked#e87 by telephone and the Miami relatives went#e88 back to Cuba for several family reunions#e89.

But Elian's case has broken#e90 down the family's fragile truce, with their political differences exacerbated#e91 by the inflammatory rhetoric flying#e92 between Castro's government and exile extremists in Miami.

After making his opinions known, Manuel Gonzalez reportedly was ostracized#e95 by his Miami kin, especially Lazaro, who has been keeping#e96 Elian and who has gone#e97 to court to try#e99 to keep#e100 the boy here.

But there has been at least one attempt#e179 at a resolution#e180. The day#t13 before#t13 last#t13 Tuesday#t13's federal court hearing#e181, Manuel went#e101 to Lazaro's home to try#e102 to work#e103 out their differences. Neither side would say#e104 what happened#e105, but when Manuel returned#e106 to his house, he was so upset he felt#e107 heart palpitations and was taken#e108 to a hospital.

He was soon released#e109 and appeared#e110 to be reasonably healthy when he appeared#e111 in court the#t16 next#t16 morning#t16. But while Cuban exiles outside the courthouse cheered#e112 Lazaro and his family, their angry taunts seemed#e113 to shock#e114 Manuel.

His lawyer, however, insists#e115 he will continue#e116 to stand#e117 up for what he thinks#e118 is right.

``He's a strong man,'' said#e119 Jeffrey Leving. ``He won't let#e120 anyone intimidate#e121 him from doing#e122 what is in Elian's best interests.''

To his credit, Lazaro Gonzalez has issued#e123 a statement asking#e124 Miami's exiles to respect#e125 his brother's opinions.

Manuel Gonzalez has told#e126 reporters that he believes#e127 his family will recover#e128 _ at least partially _ from the divisions Elian's case has brought#e129.

``The wounds of the problem will heal#e198,'' he told#e130 the Los Angeles Times newspaper. ``But the scars will always be there.''
