U.S. Surgeon General David Satcher on#s1 Wednesday#t1 led#e1 a team of medical specialists to Africa to help#e2 victims of terrorist attacks#e33 on the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.

``We want#e3 to build#e4 on the long-term partnership that has existed between our countries to help#e6 innocent Kenyans who suffered#e7 in the bombing#e34,'' Satcher said#e8 at a news conference#e35.

``At the same time, we want#e9 to help#e10 Kenya prepare to meet#e12 future#t7 medical disasters#e36, regardless of their cause.''

The bombings#e38 on#s2 Aug.#t3 7#t3 killed#e13 259 people, including 12 Americans, and injured#e55 more than 5,500.

The U.S. team includes plastic surgeons with experience in physical reconstruction, and a psychiatrist who worked#e16 in Oklahoma City, where 168 people were killed#e17 in a bombing#e41 in 1995#t4.

The team planned to leave#e19 Nairobi on#s3 Thursday#t5 for Dar es Salaam.

Besides meeting#e20 the immediate physical and emotional needs of bombing#e43 victims, the United States will consider#e21 helping#e22 set#e23 up a disaster response center in Kenya, Satcher said#e24.

In addition to providing assistance using resources of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Satcher said#e27 he will report#e28 to Congress on additional needs.

U.S. President Bill Clinton has requested#e29 dlrs 50 million in emergency assistance funding from Congress for Tanzania and Kenya.

The U.S. government already has contributed#e30 dlrs 3.2 million in assistance to the two countries.

On#s4 Friday#t6, the Kenyan government planned to pay#e32 the first 32 death claims of 100,000 Kenyan shillings (dlrs 1,667) each.
