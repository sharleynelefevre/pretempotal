Elian's Dad Lashes Out at Miami Kin  By ALAN CLENDENNING, Associated Press Writer



MIAMI (AP) --

After a weekend of bitter accusations lobbed#e1 by both sides of the Elian Gonzalez custody battle#e97, attention returned#e2 today#t1 to the federal judges deciding#e141 a key point in the international case.

The 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta has been asked#e3 by the U.S. government to suspend#e4 a ruling#e99 by one of its judges that prevents#e5 the removal#e100 of Elian from the country.

Such a decision#e101 would allow#e6 the U.S. government to push#e7 for the 6-year-old boy's swift reunion#e102 in Washington with his waiting#e103 father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, who wants#e8 to return#e9 to Cuba. He has said#e10 he will wait#e11 out appeals by the Miami relatives seeking#e12 an asylum hearing#e105 for Elian before the same court -- but only if he has custody of his son.

There was growing#e13 apprehension outside the Little Havana home where the boy has lived#e14 with his great-uncle for nearly five#t2 months#t2.

''The feeling is the Clinton administration might send#e15 federal agents to pull#e16 him out of here,'' said#e17 Sergio Navarro, a 39-year-old Miami businessman who spent#e18 part of Sunday#t3 night#t3 with chanting#e19 protesters.

Elian's relatives have cared#e20 for him since#s1 November#t4, when he was found#e21 clinging#e22 to an inner tube in the Florida Straits. His mother and 10 other people fleeing#e23 Cuba drowned#e142 when their boat sank#e24.

The Clinton administration has pushed#e25 for the boy's return#e112 to his father, ruling#e113 only he can speak#e26 for his son on immigration matters. The boy's Miami relatives say#e27 he will have a better life here and have attempted#e28 to portray Juan Miguel Gonzalez as a pawn of Fidel Castro.

The Justice Department wants#e29 the appeals court to suspend#e30 the temporary injunction issued#e31 Thursday#t5 and also order#e118 Elian's great-uncle, Lazaro Gonzalez, to release#e32 the boy. The relatives want#e33 the court to let#e34 them meet#e35 with Elian's father without being required#e36 to surrender#e37 the boy.

The court watch comes#e38 after one of the most bitter charges yet in the custody battle#e122.

Juan Miguel Gonzalez lashed#e39 out at his Miami relatives Sunday#t6 night#t6, accusing#e40 them of ''child abuse'' for turning#e41 his son against him. He said#e42 they have manipulated#e43 his son to believe#e44 that his mother still may show#e45 up someday -- in this country.

''This is child abuse and mistreatment, what they're doing#e46 to this boy,'' Gonzalez said#e47 on CBS's ''60 Minutes.'' ''The way they're abusing#e48 him, turning#e49 him against his father ... he's suffering#e50 more here amongst them than he suffered#e51 in the sea.''

Gonzalez said#e52 he didn't believe a much-publicized video taped at the relatives' home in which his son said#e55 he didn't want#e56 to go#e57. He has spoken#e58 with Elian at least three times since he arrived#e59 in the United States on#s2 April#t7 6#t7, and he insisted#e60 his son wants#e61 to return#e62 to Cuba.

''He's told#e63 me so,'' Gonzalez said#e64. The Miami relatives are ``putting#e65 a bunch of toys in front of a 6-year-old. He cannot decide#e143 for himself. The one that decides#e144 for him is me, his father.''

Elian's Miami relatives have filed#e66 affidavits alleging#e67 Gonzalez abused#e145 his former wife and his 6-year-old son, a charge Gonzalez denied#e68. During#s3 the time of the broadcast#e128 on#s4 Sunday#t8, family members and Elian were outside the home of Lazaro Gonzalez and did not publicly comment#e69 after the show#e129.

Protesters, however, dismissed#e70 Juan Miguel's comments as either selfish or the words of Fidel Castro.

''Fidel Castro is claiming#e71 the son, not him,'' said#e72 Olga Coto, 56, of Miami. ''He's being manipulated#e73 totally by Fidel Castro. He's not telling#e74 the truth.''

Many worried#e75 their efforts to keep#e76 the boy in Miami would fail#e77 today#t9, the 39th anniversary#e132 of the Bay of Pigs fiasco#e133, an aborted invasion#e134 of Cuba by CIA-trained exiles that left#e79 much bitterness among the Cuban-American community.

''We were betrayed#e146 by the government, by (President) Kennedy, and if they turned#e80 the child back over, it will be a second betrayal#e136,'' said#e81 Josefa Gonzalez, who left#e82 Cuba in#s5 1962#t10 when she was 4.

Earlier Sunday#t11, protesters prayed#e83 for divine help as Easter#t12 week#t12 began#e84, waving#e85 palm fronds and posters of the Cuban boy and Jesus. Priests joined#e86 the crowd to offer#e87 a religious service.

''There are many people who tell#e88 us that we should give#e89 up this fight#e138,'' said#e90 Martin Anorga, an evangelical pastor. ''But we will follow#e91 in the path that the Lord has shown#e92 us, despite those who want#e93 to get#e94 in our way.''
