INDEPENDENCE, MO. (AP)--

Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic today#t2 became#e1 full-fledged members of NATO, less#t4 than#t4 a#t4 decade#t4 after#s1 exchanging#e2 communist rule for democracy and shedding#e3 their Cold War military ties to the Soviet Union.

Secretary of State Madeleine Albright accepted#e4 admission papers from the three countries' foreign ministers, marking#e5 their formal entry#e6 into the 50-year-old alliance. ``Hallelujah,'' Albright exclaimed#e7.

``Hungary has come#e9 home. We are#e10 back in the family,'' said#e11 Hungarian Foreign Minister Janos Martonyi.

In a touch of symbolism, the ceremony#e12 took#e13 place at the Harry S. Truman Library. It was during#s2 the Truman presidency#e15 that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization was founded#e16 to halt#e17 the westward spread#e82 of Soviet-led communism.

Ironically, NATO's three newest members just a#t6 decade#t6 ago#t6 were#e18 still under the Soviet umbrella.

Czech Foreign Minister Jan Kavan said#e19 he was#e20 in nearby Kansas City working#e21 with the anti-Soviet undergound in#s3 1968#t7 when#s4 Russian troops swept#e22 through Praque in the occupation#e23 of Czechoslovakia.

``It is for me very symbolic that it is precisely here that we today#t8 accept#e24 the guarantee that my country never again will become#e25 the powerless victim of foreign invasion,'' Kavan said.

In looking#e26 ahead to even greater expansion#e27 of NATO, Polish Foreign Minister Bronislaw Geremek said#e28, ``We should keep#e29 the door of the alliance open for those who have fought#e30 for freedom ... Another curtain should never descend#e31 on Europe.''

There were 12 original members of NATO at the time of its founding#e32. Since#s11 1949#t9, it has been expanded#e33 to include Greece and Turkey in#s6 1952#t10, Germany in#s7 1955#t11 and Spain in#s8 1982#t12. The new additions bring#e34 the total to 19 and many other hopefuls are waiting#e81 in the wings: Slovenia, Romania, Bulgaria, Slovakia, Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia.

Just what NATO will do#e35 with these eager applicants is not clear. The issue is expected#e36 to dominate#e37 a NATO summit#e38 set for Washington in#s10 April#t13.

NATO's mission has changed#e39 dramatically since#s12 its founding#e40 in#s13 1949#t14, a time when#s14 the West was#e41 intent on halting#e42 the westward spread#e83 of Soviet-led communism -- a threat Winston Churchill warned#e43 about in his famous ``Iron Curtain'' speech delivered#e44 on#s15 March#t15 5,#t15 1946#t15, at Westminster College in Fulton, Mo., 130 miles east of here.

Now the alliance's mission is more ill-defined. NATO warplanes helped#e45 end#e46 the war#e84 in Bosnia almost#t16 four#t16 years#t16 ago#t16 and now are poised#e47 to intervene#e48 in Yugoslavia should#s16 peace efforts#e49 in the province of Kosovo fail#e50.

A#t17 decade#t17 ago#t17, the military planning of Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic was built#e51 around the possibility of a ground assault toward the west. As NATO allies, the goal is#e52 much smaller armies capable#e53 of meeting a variety of contingencies.

The State Department says#e54 the three new members ``enhance#e55 NATO's ability to fulfill its core mission of collective defense, respond#e56 to a range of security challenges and reduce#e57 the possibility of another major conflict in Europe of the kind that has claimed#e58 so many American lives.''

NATO Secretary General Javier Solana says#e59, ``The accession#e60 of the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland ... is perhaps the clearest demonstration#e61 of the fact that Europe is growing#e62 closer together.''

``Extending#e63 membership to these three democracies helps#e64 to stabilize#e65 a region that historically has been the staging ground for many of the disasters#e66 of this#t20 century#t20.''

But many Russians -- and some Americans -- are#e67 wary about the eastward encroachment of NATO. Former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev says#e68 the push east signifies#e69 a rejection#e70 of the common European security system that was discussed#e71 at#s17 the end#e72 of the Cold War.

Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov calls#e73 extending#e74 NATO membership into Eastern Europe ``a movement#e75 in the wrong direction.''

``All European states must cooperate#e76 in creating a joint security system,'' he was quoted#e77 as saying#e78. ``All European states must work#e79 together in the interests of all countries rather than of separate groups.''
