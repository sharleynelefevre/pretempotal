NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _

Terrorist bombings#e24 at U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania blew#e1 apart buildings and buses, trapping#e2 people under slabs of concrete and twisted steel that rescuers cleared#e3 with cranes, blow torches and bare hands.

At least 82 were killed#e4 and more than 1,700 injured#e36, officials said#e5 as dawn broke#e6 Saturday#t1. Dozens of people were still missing#e7, however, and the death toll was expected#e8 to rise#e9, they said#e10.

The suspected car bombings#e29 occurred 700 kilometers (450 miles) from each other but just minutes apart on Friday#t2, turning#e12 busy streets in two African capitals into bloody piles of concrete and knots of steel.

``This appears#e13 to have been a very well-coordinated, very well-planned attack#e30 _ clearly not the work of amateurs,'' U.S. National Security Council spokesman P.J. Crowley said#e16 in Washington. No one has claimed#e17 responsibility.

The blast#e33 in Nairobi occurred at about 10:35#t4 a.m.#t4 (0735 GMT) Friday#t3, toppling#e19 a crowded building toward the embassy and a street packed with cars, trucks and buses. At least 75 people were killed#e21 and 1,643 wounded#e22 there, Red Cross and ambulance officials said#e23.
