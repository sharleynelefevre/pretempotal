ATLANTA _

Good for Attorney General Janet Reno for the sensible opinion she rendered#e1 in the case of Elian Gonzalez. Some semblance of constitutional order was necessary after a Miami judge turned#e2 legal logic on its head in an effort to route#e66 to her family court his Florida relatives' appeal#e40 to keep#e4 the 6-year-old in the United States.

Immigration, after all, is strictly a federal matter. If the Immigration and Naturalization Service order#e41 that Elian must be returned#e5 to his father in Cuba is to be contested#e6, Reno ruled#e7 correctly that the only proper venue is federal court, not state or local.

If and when the relatives' appeal#e42 goes#e9 to federal court, chances of a favorable ruling#e43 are slim. First of all, the INS already has taken#e10 the position the only person who can petition#e11 for U.S. asylum for Elian is his father, which he is not about to do#e12. Moreover, immigration law provides#e13 that asylum can only be granted#e14 where there is an imminent threat of torture#e67 or persecution#e68 in the petitioner's homeland, which nobody expects#e16 in Elian's case.

It's not enough to argue#e17 Elian may suffer#e18 privation#e69 or oppression#e70 in Fidel Castro's failed#e19 Communist state. The INS routinely sends#e20 prospective immigrants back to countries where poverty and tyranny are worse than in Cuba.

What matters most is that Elian, after losing#e21 his mother and stepfather in a disastrous sea voyage#e54 to the United States last#t1 November#t1, needs#e22 the love and care of surviving family members who've known him all his life _ his father and both sets of grandparents in Cuba. True, they can't give#e25 him all the material things his Miami benefactors can, but there are intangibles in close family bonds that are more valuable than bicycles and trips#e59 to Disney World.

The next order of business for the Justice Department and the INS is to resolve#e26 Elian's case promptly. They mustn't countenance#e71 any delays by lawyers for his Miami relatives. He has been separated#e72 from his loved ones too long.

Besides, the longer his return#e62 is put#e28 off, the greater the chance of interference#e63 by calculating congressmen playing#e30 to the anti-Castro lobby. Already one grandstanding Indiana Republican has subpoenaed#e73 Elian to testify before a House panel, and others in the Senate are preparing#e31 to vote#e32 the boy U.S. citizenship. Both ploys#e64 are intended#e33 to thwart#e34 his reunion#e65 with his father.

Congress reconvenes Jan.#t2 24#t2. The Justice Department and the INS mustn't allow#e35 the opportunists of Capitol Hill to get#e36 their hooks into Elian.
