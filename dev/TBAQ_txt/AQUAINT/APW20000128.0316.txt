Cubans Demand Return of Elian

HAVANA (AP) --

Calling the mother of Elian Gonzalez ``an excellent girl,'' President Fidel Castro said#e1 Friday#t1 she had been ``practically kidnapped#e2'' by the boyfriend who perished#e125 along with her on the boat wreck#e3 her 6-year-old son survived#e4.

Castro's remarks to a conference#e77 of economists were aimed#e5 at those who say#e6 that Elian should remain in the United States because his mother sacrificed#e126 his life to take#e8 her to ``freedom,'' a vision he called#e9 a cliche.

He placed#e10 the blame on Lazaro Rafael Munero, who apparently organized#e11 the ill-fated journey#e80 on which Elian's mother Elisabeth Brotons and 10 other people -- including Munero -- died#e127.

Castro called#e14 Munero -- who reportedly drove#e15 a taxi and engaged#e16 in unofficial businesses in the Cuban city of Cardenas -- a ``ruffian'' on whom Cuban police had amassed#e128 ''100 pages of reports.''

According to sources quoted#e17 by the Miami Herald, Munero had fled#e18 to Florida in#s2 June#t2 1998#t2 and returned#e19 to Cuba later#t22 that#t22 year#t22, only to be jailed#e129 for several months.

``The mother was practically kidnapped#e20 along with the boy'' to make#e21 the late-November#t19 trip#e83, Castro said#e22.

The Cuban leader said#e23 Elian had been especially loved#e24 by his parents because the mother had earlier suffered#e25 seven miscarriages#e84.

Earlier Friday#t4, Cuba's communist government celebrated#e26 the birth#e85 of independence hero Jose Marti on#s3 Friday#t5 with rallies#e88 calling#e27 for the return#e89 of Elian Gonzalez, the ``boy martyr'' at the center of an international custody battle#e91.

Tens of thousands of children flooded#e28 Havana's Plaza of the Revolution to deliver#e29 a dual homage to Marti and Elian, the 6-year-old Cuban whose rescue#e93 off Florida's coast two#t6 months#t6 ago#t6 set#e30 off a tug-of-war between relatives living on both sides of the Florida Straits.

Wearing their red Communist Pioneer neckerchiefs, a string of young boys and girls recited#e32 poems they wrote#e33 for Elian, dubbed Cuba's ``boy hero'' and ``symbolic child,'' and for Marti, commonly known on the island as Cuba's ``teacher'' and ``apostle.''

The Communist Party daily Granma compared#e35 Elian with revolutionary icon Ernesto ``Che'' Guevara and said#e36 the boy ``has been converted#e130 forever into a symbol of the crimes and injustices that imperialism is capable of committing#e37 against an innocent.''

The commemorations were similar to those held#e38 here annually#t8 for Marti, the revolutionary and poet who fought#e39 for Cuba's independence from Spain in#s4 1898#t9. But this#t10 year#t10, children wore#e40 T-shirts bearing#e103 Elian's portrait with their school uniforms.

The commemorations began#e41 early Friday#t11 morning#t11, as tens of thousands of Cubans marched#e42 through Havana's streets by torchlight. Similar events#e104 were held#e43 all day in the capital and across the island.

In Old Havana, hundreds of children marched#e44 around the Parque Central chanting#e105 ``We will save#e45 Elian!'' A small group of girls wore#e46 construction paper handcuffs -- an apparent reference to the government's characterization of Elian's retention in the United States as a ``kidnapping#e110.''

Fidel Castro's government has been using#e47 such traditional political events#e111 -- along with other rallies#e112 almost every#t12 day#t12 -- to draw#e48 attention to the case of Elian, who was rescued#e49 Nov.#t13 25#t13 while clinging#e50 to an inner tube. His mother and 10 others died#e131 at sea while trying#e51 to reach#e52 the United States.

For the#t21 past#t21 two#t21 months#t21, Elian's father has demanded#e53 that the boy be returned#e54 to him in Cuba, and the U.S. government has said#e55 that father and son should be reunited#e132.

But Elian's paternal great-uncle in the United States, backed#e56 by the anti-Castro Cuban American National Foundation, is fighting#e57 in the courts to keep#e58 the boy in Miami.

Cuba kept#e59 up its condemnation#e114 of the handling#e115 of Wednesday#t16's meeting#e116 between Elian and his grandmothers at the home of a Roman Catholic nun in Miami Beach, Fla. Sister Jeanne O'Laughlin said#e60 after the meeting#e117 she thought#e61 Elian should stay in the United States.

``First Fruits of the Monstrousness,'' read#e63 the full-page editorial on the front of Friday#t17's edition of the Communist Party daily Granma. It offered#e64 more details and criticisms of the perceived treatment that Elian's grandmothers, Mariela Quintana and Raquel Rodriguez, received#e65 from O'Laughlin, the Miami relatives and other anti-Castro Cubans during the encounter#e120.

In an interview#e121 with the Spanish language broadcast of CNN, Elian's father also criticized#e66 how the meeting#e123 was handled#e67. He repeated#e68 charges that his relatives and others in Miami had offered#e69 him money to stay#e70 in the United States with his son.

``They are not going#e71 to buy#e72 me,'' said#e73 Juan Miguel Gonzalez. ``What is important for me is that they return#e74 the boy to me as soon as possible.''
