Elian Gonzalez will remain in the United States for at least two#t13 more#t13 weeks#t13 even after a federal appeals court Thursday#t1 refused#e2 to order#e3 a political asylum hearing#e127 for the fought-over Cuban child.

Elian could be forced#e5 to stay#e6 longer if the Miami relatives who are seeking#e7 asylum for the child over his Cuban father's objections pursue further appeals#e129. Attorney Kendall Coffey said#e8 his clients were giving#e9 an appeal#e130 to the Supreme Court ``serious consideration.''

The Miami relatives could also request#e10 a rehearing#e132 before the same three-judge panel that issued#e11 Thursday#t2's ruling#e133, or before the entire 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeal. But Thursday#t3's decision#e134 made#e12 it clear the family has only 14#t4 days#t4 to decide whether to request#e14 a rehearing#e135 at that level. &UR;

&LR; ``Expect no extensions#e136,'' the court instructed#e15.

The ruling#e137 follows#e211 six#t5 months#t5 of international family infighting, political recriminations and wide-spread protests#e140 in both Miami and Cuba over the fate of the 6-year-old boy.

His mother died#e200 trying#e17 to smuggle#e18 Elian out of Cuba, and it has been difficult for family members, Miami community leaders and many politicians to separate#e19 attitudes about Cuban leader Fidel Castro from the legal issues involved.

The appellate ruling#e143 made#e21 it clear the court takes#e23 no joy in lifting#e24 an obstacle to Elian's return#e144 to Cuba.

``We acknowledge#e25, as a widely accepted truth, that Cuba does violate#e27 human rights and fundamental freedoms and does not guarantee#e28 the rule of law to people living in Cuba,'' wrote#e30 Judge J.L. Edmonson, on behalf of the panel.

But the Immigration and Naturalization Service's decision#e148 to deny#e31 Elian an asylum hearing#e149 was ``within the outside border of reasonable choices,'' the opinion read#e151. ``The court neither approves#e32 nor disapproves#e33 the INS' decision#e152 to reject#e34 the asylum applications filed#e35 on plaintiff's behalf, but the INS decision#e155 did not contradict (federal law.)''

The judges denied#e36, however, a request#e156 by Elian's father to name#e37 him instead of great-uncle Lazaro Gonzalez as Elian's representative in the continued#e38 court proceedings#e157. Making Juan Miguel Gonzalez his son's legal representative would have allowed#e39 him to simply drop#e40 the asylum request#e158 and head#e201 for home.

Elian's great-uncle vowed#e202 to continue#e41 the battle#e159, and said#e42 the Miami relatives might sue#e203 for visitation while the child is in the United States.

``We will keep#e43 fighting#e44 with the laws ... so Elian Gonzalez can live in a free country like his mother wanted#e46,'' Lazaro Gonzalez said#e47.

President Clinton and Attorney General Janet Reno praised#e48 the ruling#e162, with both stressing#e49 their confidence that Juan Miguel Gonzalez is the best person to raise#e50 his child. &UR;

&LR; ``As I've said#e51 before, this is a case about the importance of family and the bond between a father and son,'' Clinton said#e52 in a written#e53 statement#e165 issued#e54 from Berlin.

Elian's father asked#e55 his Miami relatives to end#e56 their court battle#e166 after#s1 Thursday#t6's ruling#e167 and allow#e57 him to finally return#e204 home with his son.

``A child should simply be with his parents, always his parents,'' the elder Gonzalez said#e58 through an interpreter. Switching to English, he said#e59, ``I want#e60 to thank#e61 the American people. Thank you.''

Elian was rescued#e62 off the coast of Florida by two American fishermen last#t7 November#t7 after#s2 the boat he was in capsized#e63. Elian's mother and 10 others died#e205, but the boy survived#e64 by clinging#e65 to an inner tube.

Elian's Miami relatives took#e66 in the child, but then refused#e67 to return#e68 him to his surviving father in Cuba, citing#e70 the harshness of the Castro regime.

The Miami relatives applied#e206 for political asylum on Elian's behalf, saying#e71 the child did not want#e72 to return#e73 to Cuba. INS agents traveled#e74 to Cuba to interview#e75 the child's father before the INS rejected#e76 the application for asylum, saying#e77 the child's father was the only person authorized#e78 to represent#e79 him. A district court judge upheld#e80 the federal agency.

The Miami relatives appealed#e81 that decision#e172, and obtained#e82 an injunction#e173 requiring Elian to remain in the United States until the asylum question worked#e85 its way through the courts. Juan Miguel Gonzalez arrived#e86 in the United States April#t8 2#t8, and Reno ordered#e87 the Miami relatives to surrender#e88 the child to his father.

The family refused#e89, and federal agents took#e90 the child by force in a pre-dawn raid#e175 on the Miami relatives' home on#s3 April#t9 22#t9.

The father and his son lived#e91 for a#t10 month#t10 on a large, private estate in Maryland, but have recently moved#e92 to an affluent neighborhood in Washington, D.C., to wait#e93 out the rest of their time in the United States.

Shortly after the appellate panel released#e94 its decision#e176, attorney Coffey filed#e95 an emergency request#e178 to Supreme Court Justice Anthony M. Kennedy (who has jurisdiction over such matters from Florida) requesting#e96 assurance that Elian will remain in the United States until the full Supreme Court can consider#e98 a formal appeal#e181.

But Reno said#e99 the request#e182 to Kennedy serves#e100 no purpose since the injunction#e183 blocking#e101 Elian's return#e184 to Cuba still applies. If the family fails#e102 to file#e103 an appeal#e185 within 14#t11 days#t11, she said#e104, the soonest Elian would be free to leave#e105 the country would be seven days later.

However, Justice Department officials said#e106 the appellate court could decide#e207 to waive#e208 the extra seven-day#t15 period.

Protesters were beginning#e107 to gather#e108 outside the Miami relatives' home even before the ruling#e186 was issued#e109. They yelled#e209 and wept#e110 when the decision#e187 was announced#e111.

In a statement#e188 read#e189 on Cuban television, Castro's government expressed#e112 its displeasure at still another delay#e190 in Elian's return#e191. The government called#e113 the 14-day#t16 waiting period ``another concession#e192 to the `mafia' _ a disparaging term the government frequently uses#e116 to describe#e117 Miami's exile Cuban community.

Jose Basulto, founder of Brothers to the Rescue, a Cuban exile group that frequently rescues#e118 Cuban refugees from the Straits of Florida, called#e119 the latest ruling#e195 ``outrageous.''

``The saga of Elian Gonzalez is a turning#e120 point in relations in the Cuban community and the United States,'' Basulto said#e121. ``This day, in the history of their relations with the United States, will be remembered#e122 in the Cuban community in the same way the Bay of Pigs is remembered#e123.''

Cuban exiles failed#e124 to overthrow#e125 Castro in#s4 1961#t12 when the communist leader repelled#e210 their invasion#e199 at the Bay of Pigs.
