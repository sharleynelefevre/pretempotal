Albright Praises African Cooperation in Bombing Probe



WASHINGTON, August 11 (Xinhua) --

U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said#e1 on#s1 Tuesday#t2 that she was heartened by cooperation#e40 from Kenya and Tanzania in probing#e2 into last#t3 Friday#t3's bombings#e41 of U.S. embassies.

"I have been heartened by the close cooperation#e42 we have had with authorities in Kenya and Tanzania from the moment the tragedies#e43 occurred," Albright told#e4 ambassadors and charges d'affaires of 30 African countries in Washington, who came#e6 to the State Department to offer#e7 condolences.

"I want#e8 to thank#e9 you for the help#e45 that your governments have provided#e10 by sharing#e11 information and tightening#e12 security at our embassies in recent#t8 days#t8," she said#e13.

The bombings#e46 at U.S embassies in Kenya and Tanzania have killed#e14 more than 200 people, including 12 Americans, and wounded#e16 over 5,000.

The United States has dispatched#e17 FBI agents to Africa to investigate#e18 the bombings#e47 but there was no word in Washington on#s2 Tuesday#t4 of any significant leads so far.

Tanzanian police said#e19 on#s3 Tuesday#t5 they had arrested#e20 14 foreigners in their search#e49 for bombers. The 14 foreigners, six Iraqis, six Sudanese, a Somali national and a Turk, were rounded#e21 up because they failed#e22 to explain#e23 their presence in the country satisfactorily.

Albright announced#e24 on Monday#t6 to offer#e25 a reward of up to 2 million U.S. dollars for information leading to the arrest#e52 and conviction#e53 of the bombers.

She told#e27 African envoys that she looked#e28 forward to visiting#e29 Kenya and Tanzania but would wait#e30 until she could do#e62 so without placing undue burdens on the heavily stretched U.S. embassies there.

She also said#e34 the bombings#e54 would not prevent#e35 the United States from building "a strong new relationship with a new Africa."

Egyptian Ambassador Ahmed Maher el-Sayed, on behalf of the African envoys, condemned#e36 the "cowardly, criminal and tragic" bombings#e56.

"Terrorism is inconsistent with our African history, our tradition, our culture and our beliefs," he said#e37. "Americans and Africans need#e38 to strengthen#e39 their cooperation in this universal battle#e59" against terrorism.
