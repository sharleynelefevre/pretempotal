A CHILD ONCE AGAIN

The Clinton administration's wisdom in returning#e1 Elian Gonzalez to his father was confirmed#e2 over the#t4 weekend#t4 decision of his Miami relatives and their Republican allies to further politicize what ought to be a straightforward child-custody case. Elian is finally getting#e4 time to reconnect#e63 with his father in a quiet, neutral setting where he is no longer a metaphor for the war#e44 between the Cubans.

A few miles from his temporary home at Andrews Air Force Base, Senator Bob Smith of New Hampshire, Representative Tom DeLay of Texas, both Republicans, and the relatives were treating#e5 the raid#e45 to return#e6 Elian as though it were a Nazi SS operation#e46. Yet federal agents had a warrant, were enforcing#e7 US law, and entered#e8 the house with the proper force to ensure#e9 minimal resistance#e47 and injury#e48. It was a model of efficient law enforcement, guided by due process.

The raid#e51 was necessary because the Gonzalez relatives in Miami, refusing#e10 to return#e11 the boy, made him into a symbol of resistance to Fidel Castro. Elian printed#e13 his name on an application for asylum and was put#e14 in front of a video camera to say#e15 that he did not want#e16 to go#e17 back to Cuba. The relatives treated#e18 the boy like a political prop.

As did Castro, a master manipulator of public opinion in Cuba. Had the relatives allowed#e20 Elian to return#e21 to Cuba, they would have denied#e22 the dictator an opportunity to reenergize#e64 support for his regime.

Juan Miguel Gonzalez apparently is a Castro supporter, but that should not disqualify#e65 him from being reunited#e66 with his child. Ever since he first learned#e23 that Elian was in Florida last#t2 November#t2, he has been persistent in seeking#e24 the boy's return#e57.

Elian has developed#e25 great affection for the Miami relatives. It would be ideal if they could have returned#e26 him to his father yet stayed#e27 in contact while their appeal#e60 was pending in court. Negotiations failed#e28, however, because they insisted#e29 on taking#e30 the place of the father, rather than being treated#e31 as concerned, yet distant, relatives.

Juan and Elian Gonzalez will remain in the United States pending the appeal#e61. The father can remain here, but he can also return#e35 to Cuba if he wishes#e36. Like any other 6-year-old in the care of a loving parent, Elian should go#e38 wherever that parent wants#e39.
