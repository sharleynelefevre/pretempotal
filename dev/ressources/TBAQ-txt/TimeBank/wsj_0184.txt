Upjohn Offers @ Plan to Reduce @ Its Work Force @ ---- @ By Bradley A. Stertz @ Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal 11/02/89 WALL STREET JOURNAL (J) UPJ DRUG MANUFACTURERS (DRG) KALAMAZOO, Mich.


Upjohn Co. said#e1 it will offer#e2 an early retirement package to as many as 1,100 employees in a cost-cutting move#e3 expected#e5 to result#e7 in a fourth-quarter#t79 charge#e80.

Upjohn officials said#e8 they couldn't estimate#e9 the size of the charge#e81 until they determine#e12 which employees, and how many, will participate#e14 in the retirement plan. But the pharmaceutical company said#e16 it "anticipates#e17 the long-term savings resulting from the plan's implementation will more than offset#e91 short-term costs."

The program, available to Upjohn employees 55 years old or older, could increase#e24 an individual's retirement benefits 10% to 20%. In addition, Upjohn is offering#e29 a one-time retirement bonus equal to six months of base pay.

Chairman Theodore Cooper called#e31 the program part of the company's two-year#t190 strategy#e189 to implement#e33 budget constraints and "an effective headcount-control program."

But some analysts questioned#e34 how much of an impact the retirement package will have#e36, because few jobs will end#e38 up being eliminated#e86. "It's a cosmetic move#e39," said#e40 Jonathan S. Gelles of Wertheim Schroder amp Co.

According to Upjohn's estimates, only 50% to 60% of the 1,100 eligible employees will take#e42 advantage of the plan. Upjohn further estimated#e43 that about 50% of the employees who leave#e44 for early retirement may be replaced#e46. As a result, Upjohn will likely trim#e50 only about 275 to 350 of its more than 21,000 jobs world-wide.

In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday#t92, Upjohn shares rose#e53 87.5 cents to $38.875 apiece.

An Upjohn spokesman said#e54 he had " heard#e399 nothing" to suggest#e57 the early retirement package was spurred#e58 by shareholder pressure or a potential bidder for the company, which occasionally has been the target of takeover speculation. The company earlier#t372>this#t372>year#t372 adopted#e61 a shareholder-rights plan to ward#e63 off unwanted suitors.

The spokesman said#e64 it is the first early retirement plan offered#e65 under its two-year#t500 cost-control strategy. Earlier#t404 staff-reduction moves#e66 have trimmed#e67 about 300 jobs, the spokesman said#e69.
