DD Acquisition Corp., a partnership of Unicorp Canada Corp.'s Kingsbridge Capital Group and Cara Operations Ltd., extended#e2 to Nov.#t41>20#t41 its $45-a-share offer#e3000 for all Dunkin' Donuts Inc. shares outstanding.

The offer, which was due#e49 to expire#e6 yesterday#t44, is conditional#e45 on 50.1% of Dunkin' common shares, on a fully diluted basis, being tendered#e7 and on the withdrawal#e8 of the company's poison pill rights plan.

Acquisition has launched#e11 a suit in a Delaware court seeking#e13 the withdrawal#e14 of Dunkin's poison pill rights and employee stock ownership plans, which it claims#e50 were put#e208 in place to deter#e18 bidders. Acquisition said#e20 2.2 million shares, or about 38.5% of the shares outstanding, have been tendered#e21 under its offer. The partners said#e23 they already#t51 hold#e24 15% of all shares outstanding.

Dunkin' has set#e25 Nov.#t52>10#t52 as the deadline for the receipt of any competing bids. DD Acquisition said#e28 the extension#e29 is to allow#e206 this process to be completed#e34. Dunkin' is based in Randolph, Mass. Cara, a food services chain operator and Unicorp, a holding company, are based in Toronto.
