Officials in California are warning#e1 residents that oncoming rains#e40 will cause#e3 dangerous and unpredictable landslides#e41. From member station KQED, Auncil Martinez reports#e42.

Experts say#e5 the ground is so saturated#e6 it cannot absorb#e8 any more water. So that means#e9 soil will fall#e43 off in chunks and destroy#e11 anything in its path. In Los Angeles that lesson was brought home today#t38 when tons of earth cascaded#e16 down a hillside, ripping#e17 two houses from their foundations. No one was hurt#e18, but firefighters ordered#e19 the evacuation#e45 of nearby homes and said#e20 they'll monitor#e21 the shifting ground. In the northern California town of Rio Nido, officials say#e23 a football field sized slab of hillside could still break#e25 loose at any time and destroy#e29 an entire neighborhood. And in San Francisco, a mansion overlooking the Pacific Ocean and the Golden Gate Bridge is slipping#e31 toward the sea. Forecasters say#e32 the picture will get#e33 worse because more rains#e47 are on the way. For NPR news, I'm Auncil Martinez reporting#e36.
