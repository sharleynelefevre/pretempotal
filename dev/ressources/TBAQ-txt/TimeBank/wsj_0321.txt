StatesWest Airlines, Phoenix, Ariz., said#e1 it withdrew#e2 its offer#e3 to acquire#e5 Mesa Airlines because the Farmington, N.M., carrier didn't respond#e6 to its offer#e8 by the close#e9 of business yesterday#t41, a deadline StatesWest had set#e11 for a response.

However, StatesWest isn't abandoning#e12 its pursuit#e14 of the much-larger Mesa. StatesWest, which has a 7.25% stake in Mesa, said#e17 it may purchase#e18 more Mesa stock or make#e20 a tender offer#e21 directly to Mesa shareholders.

StatesWest had proposed#e22 acquiring#e23 Mesa for $7 a share and one share of a new series of StatesWest 6% convertible preferred stock it values at $3 a share. Earlier, Mesa had rejected#e26 a general proposal#e27 from StatesWest to combine#e29 the two carriers in some way.

StatesWest serves 10 cities in California, Arizona and Nevada. Mesa flies to 42 cities in New Mexico, Arizona, Wyoming, Colorado and Texas.
