Hudson's Bay Co. announced#e1 terms of a previously proposed rights issue that is expected#e2 to raise#e4 about 396 million Canadian dollars (US$337 million) net of expenses.

Proceeds of the offering will be used#e7 to redeem#e9 C$264 million of preferred shares and to reduce#e11 short-term debt, the company said#e12.

Canada's largest department store operator said#e13 the rights offering will entitle#e15 holders of its ordinary shares, except residents in the U.S. and Britain, to subscribe#e17 for two additional shares for every five shares held at a price of C$31.25 a share. The record date is Nov.#t50>9#t50.

The company has#e21 about 31 million ordinary shares outstanding. On the Toronto Stock Exchange, Hudson's Bay shares closed#e22 at C$35, up 12.5 cents.

Hudson's Bay said#e23 that Woodbridge Co., which currently#t51 holds#e24 about 77% of the ordinary shares, will subscribe#e25 for all the shares to which it is entitled and for any shares that aren't otherwise taken up. Woodbridge is a holding company owned by Toronto's Thomson family.

Hudson's Bay said#e30 it will redeem#e31 9.5 million Series H preferred shares on Oct.#t52>31#t52 at a price of C$27.75 each. The move#e33 was approved#e34 at a special shareholders' meeting#e35 yesterday#t53.

Gary Lukassen, chief financial officer, said#e36 redemption#e188 of the preferred shares, originally issued#e38 at C$25 each, will eliminate#e39 dividend payments#e40 of C$17.9 million annually#t1000.
