General Motors Corp.'s big defense and automotive electronics unit, GM Hughes Electronics, said#e2 net income fell#e3 22% in the#t74>third#t74>quarter#t74, reflecting declining military spending and slumping GM vehicle production#e75.

Meanwhile, net at GM's finance arm, General Motors Acceptance Corp., fell#e8 3.1%. By contrast, Electronic Data Systems Corp., GM's data processing subsidiary, boosted#e10 net 16%.

GM closed#e11 down $1.875 at $44.875 in New York Stock Exchange trading#e79 yesterday#t80. Earnings for GM common stock, reflecting the performance of GM's core automotive operations#e14, will be disclosed#e15 this#t81>morning#t81. GM Class H, which represents a dividend interest in Hughes earnings, closed#e17 at $29, up 25 cents in Big Board composite trading. GM Class E, which represents a dividend interest in EDS profit, fell#e19 75 cents to $52.25 on the Big Board.

The earnings drop#e20 at GM Hughes Electronics is a sign of tough times at both the defense operations of Hughes Aircraft Co. and GM's North American automotive operations, which are a primary customer for the Delco Electronics Corp. side of the GM Hughes unit.

Profit at the unit fell#e24 to $110.6 million, or 37 cents a share, from $142.4 million, or 45 cents a share, largely because of a $24 million one-time charge#e91 associated with Hughes's previously announced#e26 plan#e93 to reduce#e28 employment by at least 6,000 people by year#t96>end#t96. Even excluding the charge, however, net fell#e32 5%.

In addition, GM's North American vehicle production fell#e35 8.4% from a#t97>year#t97>ago#t97, which hurt#e36 Delco Electronic's earnings, a company spokesman said#e37. That decline#e99 was reflected in revenue for the GM Hughes unit, which edged#e39 down to $2.58 billion from $2.63 billion.

In the#t105>nine#t105>months#t105, GM Hughes net fell#e40 6.6% to $486.6 million, or $1.48 a share, from $521 million, or $1.58 a share. Revenue rose#e41 3.5% to $8.47 billion from $8.18 billion.

At GMAC, net dropped#e42 3.1% to $234.5 million from $241.9 million. The finance unit attributed#e43 the decline#e118 to higher borrowing costs compared with a#t120>year#t120>earlier#t120. GMAC said#e45 its automotive financing and leasing business rose#e48 35% in the U.S., largely because of dealer and customer incentives used#e49 to boost#e51 sales. GMAC profits are combined with earnings from the rest of GM's operations and attributed to the company's traditional common stock.

In the#t126>first#t126>nine#t126>months#t126, GMAC's earnings fell#e57 8% to $859.5 million from $930.2 million.

At EDS, third-quarter#t129 profit jumped#e58 16% to a record $110.9 million, or 93 cents a share, from $95.9 million, or 79 cents a share. Revenue rose#e60 12% to $1.37 billion from $1.22 billion.

In the#t144>nine#t144>months#t144, EDS earned#e61 $315.8 million, or $2.62 a share, up 13% from $280.7 million, or $2.30 a share. Revenue rose#e62 14% to $4.03 billion from $3.54 billion. Revenue from non-GM accounts was 45% of EDS's total business in the#t151>latest#t151>nine#t151>months#t151, compared with 40% a#t152>year#t152>earlier#t152. The company has said#e67 it wants#e68 to boost#e70 non-GM revenue to at least 50% of its total business by the#t155>end#t155>of#t155>1990#t155.
