Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says#e1 considerable gaps remain#e2 between Israeli and Palestinian positions before next#t19>week#t19's talks#e22 in London. He and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat meet#e3 separately Monday#t20 with US Secretary of State Madeleine Albright. At a news conference#e61 with US Vice President Al Gore in Jerusalem, Mr. Netanyahu suggested#e4 Israel might be willing#e24 to move#e25 a little on issues holding#e6 up peace, but he said#e7 he expects#e8 an equal effort#e27 from the Palestinians.

If Israel is asked#e9 to uh stretch#e10 itself on matters that are vital to its security concerns, then we must see#e12 an equal effort on the other side.

Mr. Gore called#e15 on Israel to continue#e16 taking#e17 risks for peace.
