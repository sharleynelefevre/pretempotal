National Intergroup Inc. said#e1 it expects#e2 to report#e4 a charge#e48 of $5.3 million related to the sale#e6 of its aluminum unit's extrusion division for the#t52>third#t52>quarter#t52.

The company said#e7 it has agreed#e8 to sell#e10 the extrusion division for $15 million to R.D. Werner Co., a closely held firm based in Greenville, Pa.

National Intergroup in the#t59>year-ago#t59>third#t59>quarter#t59 earned#e19 $22.5 million, or 97 cents a share, including a gain#e60 of $18 million from the sale#e20 of a steel tube company. Revenue was $778.6 million.

The company also said#e22 it continues#e23 to explore#e25 all options concerning the possible sale#e28 of National Aluminum's 54.5% stake in an aluminum smelter in Hawesville, Ky.

The sale#e31 of the extrusion division is subject to audit adjustments#e34 for working capital changes through the closing.

The agreement also provides for potential payments#e41 of additional proceeds to National Aluminum over the#t220>next#t220>two#t220>years#t220, depending on the plant's shipping levels.
