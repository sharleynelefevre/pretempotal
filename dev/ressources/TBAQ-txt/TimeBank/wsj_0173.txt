Coleco Industries Inc., a once#t30 high-flying toy maker whose stock peaked#e1 at $65 a share in the#t26>early#t26>1980s#t26, filed#e2 a Chapter 11 reorganization plan that provides#e3 just 1.125 cents a share for common stockholders.

Under the plan, unsecured creditors, who are owed#e4 about $430 million, would receive#e5 about $92 million, or 21 cents for each dollar they are owed#e7. In addition, they will receive#e8 stock in the reorganized company, which will be named#e9 Ranger Industries Inc. After these payments#e1990, about $225,000 will be available#e1991 for the 20 million common shares outstanding.

The Avon, Conn., company's stock hit#e10 a high in 1983#t27 after it unveiled#e11 its Adam home computer, but the product was plagued#e12 with glitches and the company's fortunes plunged#e13. But Coleco bounced#e14 back with the introduction#e1993 of the Cabbage Patch dolls, whose sales hit#e15 $600 million in 1985#t28. But as the craze died#e16, Coleco failed#e17 to come#e18 up with another winner and filed#e19 for bankruptcy-law protection in July#t29>1988#t29.

The plan was filed#e20 jointly with unsecured creditors in federal bankruptcy court in New York and must be approved#e22 by the court.
