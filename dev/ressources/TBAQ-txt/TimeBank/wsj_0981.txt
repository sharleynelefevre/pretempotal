MGM Grand Inc. has agreed#e1 to pay#e3 $93 million and nearly 1.8 million common shares to buy#e5 117 acres of land along the Las Vegas, Nev., Strip as a site for its planned movie-studio and theme-park resort.

Of the total purchase price, $50 million cash and $30 million in stock (nearly 1.8 million shares) would be paid#e8 to buy#e11 the existing 700-room Marina Hotel amp Casino from Southwest Securities, a Nevada limited partnership. The remaining properties to be acquired#e13 are the Tropicana Country Club amp Golf Course, a facility jointly owned by Ramada Inc., of Phoenix, Ariz., and the Jaffe family, and a small parcel owned by MGM Grand director James D. Aljian.

The purchase price was disclosed#e17 in a preliminary prospectus issued#e18 in connection with MGM Grand's planned offering of six million common shares. The luxury airline and casino company, 98.6%-owned by investor Kirk Kerkorian and his Tracinda Corp., earlier this#t95>month#t95 announced#e22 its agreements#e23 to acquire#e25 the properties, but didn't disclose#e26 the purchase price.

The proposed stock offering#e28 and issuance#e29 of nearly 1.8 million common shares in connection with the land purchase will bring#e32 MGM Grand's total shares outstanding to 28.7 million, of which 72% will be owned#e33 by Mr. Kerkorian and Tracinda, according#e100 to the prospectus.

In over-the-counter trading#e34, MGM Grand was bid#e35 at $17.50 a share.

Proceeds from the offering are expected#e38 to be used#e40 for remodeling#e41 the company's Desert Inn resort in Las Vegas, refurbishing#e101 certain aircraft of the MGM Grand Air unit, and to acquire#e43 the property for the new resort. The company said#e44 it estimates#e45 the Desert Inn remodeling will cost#e46 about $32 million, and the refurbishment#e103 of the three DC-8-62 aircraft, made by McDonnell Douglas Corp., will cost#e48 around $24.5 million.

MGM Grand said#e49 the latest stock offering won't cover#e51 the $600 million or more cost of building#e2188 the proposed resort and theme park, and added#e54 it will need#e55 to seek#e57 additional financing, either through bank borrowings or debt and equity offerings, at a#t104>later#t104>date#t104. Construction#e63 is set#e64 to begin#e66 in early#t105>1991#t105.

The resort will include the MGM Grand Hotel, a multi-spired, castle-like facility that will include 5,000 rooms and 85,000 square feet of casino space. The facility will be marketed#e69 toward families, and room rates will be between $35 and $55 a night, MGM Grand said#e70.

The prospectus didn't include#e71 many details about the studio and theme park, although conceptual drawings, released#e75 this#t108>month#t108, show#e76 that it may feature#e77 several "themed" areas similar to those found at parks built by Walt Disney Co.
