Ralston Profit @ Declined 47% @ In 4th Quarter @ --- @ By Richard Gibson @ Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal 11/02/89 WALL STREET JOURNAL (J) RAL EARNINGS (ERN) FOOD PRODUCTS (FOD)


Ralston Purina Co. reported#e1 a 47% decline#e1991 in fourth-quarter#t38 earnings#e2018, reflecting#e2 restructuring costs#e2033 as well as a more difficult pet food market.

The St. Louis company earned#e3 $45.2 million, or 65 cents a share, compared with $84.9 million, or $1.24 a share, a#t39>year#t39>earlier#t39. Sales#e2044 in the#t42>latest#t42>period#t42 were $1.76 billion, a 13% increase#e1992 from last#t43>year#t43's $1.55 billion.

For the#t41>year#t41 ended#e5 Sept.#t40>30#t40, Ralston earned#e6 $422.5 million, or $6.44 a share, up 8.9% from $387.8 million, or $5.63 a share. This#t50>year#t50's results#e1993 included a gain#e1994 of $70.2 million on the disposal#e8 of seafood operations. Sales#e1995 for the#t44>full#t44>year#t44 were $6.6 billion, up 13% from $5.8 billion.

Ralston said#e10 its restructuring costs include#e11 the phase-out#e1996 of a battery facility in Greenville, N.C., the recent#t45 closing#e1997 of a Hostess cake bakery in Cincinnati and a reduction#e1998 in staff throughout the company. The battery plant, which makes#e13 rechargeable nickel cadmium and carbon zinc products, will be closed#e14 over the#t46>next#t46>year#t46>or#t46>so#t46, a spokesman said#e2000.

Ralston attributed#e15 its fourth-quarter#t47 slump#e2001 partly to higher costs of ingredients in the pet food business as well as competitive pressures, which required#e18 higher advertising spending#e2004. For the#t48>year#t48, pet food volume was flat#e2154, the company said#e19.

Its cereal division realized#e20 higher operating profit on volume increases#e21, but also spent#e2006 more on promotion. The Continental Baking business benefited#e26 from higher margins on bread and on increased cake sales#e2008, it added#e30.

Ralston said#e31 its Eveready battery unit was hurt#e32 by continuing economic problems#e2009 in South America.

Ralston shares closed#e34 yesterday#t49 at $80.50, off $1, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.
