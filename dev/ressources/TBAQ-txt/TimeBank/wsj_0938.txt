Cineplex Odeon Corp. directors said#e1 the company's chairman and chief executive, Garth Drabinsky, is considering#e2 bidding#e3 780.6 million Canadian dollars (US$666 million) to acquire#e5 the company.

The board said#e6 Mr. Drabinsky and Vice Chairman Myron Gottlieb are negotiating#e7 financing#e8 before offering#e10 C$16.40 a share to acquire#e12 all of Cineplex's shares outstanding. The directors added#e13 that the two executives haven't reached#e14 a final decision#e16 to proceed#e18 with a bid#e19 and that until an offer#e20 is made#e22 the board will continue#e23 seeking#e24 higher offers from other bidders.

The directors said#e26 if Messrs. Drabinsky and Gottlieb mail#e176 an offer#e180 to shareholders by Nov.#t179>22#t179, it will reimburse#e29 them a maximum of C$8.5 million for expenses related to a bid.

"We consider#e33 that his bid is an acceptable bid," said#e36 Sandra Kolber, spokeswoman for the independent directors' committee appointed#e37 last#t183>May#t183 to solicit#e39 and review#e40 bids for the company in the wake of a dispute#e43 between Mr. Drabinsky and Cineplex's major shareholder, MCA Inc.

MCA and Cineplex's other major shareholder, Montreal-based financier Charles Bronfman and his associates, have agreed#e44 to tender#e46 their holdings to an offer#e3000 by Mr. Drabinsky unless a higher offer is made#e50 by another bidder. MCA holds half of Cineplex's equity and 33% of its voting rights through restricted voting shares, while Bronfman interests hold about 24% of the company's equity.

Ms. Kolber said#e55 the committee had received#e56 other bids. She declined#e58 to identify#e60 other bidders but said#e61 Mr. Drabinsky's offer "is all cash, and it's for all of the company." Several Cineplex analysts have speculated#e64 that outside bids received by the committee were either disappointingly low#e223 or for only part of the company.

"All this has really established is that MCA and the Bronfmans have agreed#e68 on a price at which they can be bought#e70 out," said#e72 Jeffery Logsdon, an analyst with Crowell, Weedon in Los Angeles. "If a bid materializes#e74 at that price, shareholders will have every reason to be glad#e192, but the question of financing still remains#e81."

Last#t193>April#t193, Mr. Drabinsky and a group of financial backers planned#e82 to acquire#e84 up to 30.2% of Cineplex for C$17.50 a share from Bronfman associates. Mr. Drabinsky, who would have had#e195 the right to vote#e85 those shares for two#t201>years#t201, said#e86 the purchase#e202, subsequently rejected#e88 by regulators, was aimed#e89 at consolidating#e91 his control of the company. MCA strongly opposed#e92 the Drabinsky group's move.

The directors didn't indicate#e94 the source of financing for Mr. Drabinsky's new proposal, but said#e98 MCA and the Bronfman associates agreed#e99 in principle to buy#e101 for $57 million and then lease#e207 back to Cineplex its 18-screen theater complex in Universal City, Calif., if Mr. Drabinsky succeeds#e103 in an offer.

"This is being done#e106 at the suggestion#e107 of {Mr. Drabinsky} and to accommodate#e110 him, to facilitate#e112 his financing arrangements#e208," Ms. Kolber said#e113.

In addition, the directors said#e115 if a bid by Mr. Drabinsky is successful#e209, Cineplex expects#e118 Rank Organisation PLC to acquire#e120 the 51% of Cineplex's Film House unit it doesn't own#e211, and provide#e122 Mr. Drabinsky with additional loan financing.

Michael Gifford, Rank's chief executive, said#e124 the British theater chain's total involvement "wouldn't exceed#e126 $100 million" but declined#e129 to give#e131 a breakdown between the loan financing and the proposed Film House purchase.

Cineplex shareholders responded#e135 coolly to yesterday#t212's announcement#e136. In trading#e214 on the New York Stock Exchange, Cineplex closed#e138 at $11, down 25 cents, with more than a million shares changing hands. On the Toronto Stock Exchange, Cineplex closed#e141 at C$12.875, off 37.5 Canadian cents, well below the C$16.40 level.

"Where's the bid?" asked Pierre Panet-Raymond, an analyst and broker with Toronto securities dealer McDermid St. Lawrence Ltd. Mr. Panet-Raymond said#e144 he doesn't think#e145 Messrs. Drabinsky and Gottlieb are "anywhere close#e147" to arranging#e148 financing#e149 and that investors will need#e150 a solid offer#e222 before the stock begins#e153 to rise#e155 again.

Mr. Drabinsky couldn't be reached#e156 for comment.
