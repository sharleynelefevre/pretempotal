Xerox Corp. has told#e1 employees in its Crum amp Forster personal insurance operations that it is laying#e2 off about 300 people, or 25% of the staff.

A spokeswoman for Crum amp Forster said#e3 employees were told#e4 early#t21>this#t21>week#t21 that numerous staff functions for the personal insurance lines were going to be centralized#e6 as a cost-cutting move.

She said#e7 the move#e82 would result#e8 in a after-tax charge of less than $4 million to be spread#e10 over the#t23>next#t23>three#t23>quarters#t23. By comparison, for the#t24>first#t24>nine#t24>months#t24, Xerox earned#e11 $492 million, or $4.55 a share, on revenue of $12.97 billion.

Earnings at Xerox's financial-services operations actually rose#e12 slightly, but that was largely because capital gains at Crum amp Forster offset#e13 Hurricane Hugo payments and the reserves set up to cover future payments#e3000.

Property/casualty insurance has been a tough business in recent#t25>quarters#t25, as pricing has been cutthroat and natural disasters such as Hurricane Hugo and the California earthquake have resulted in huge payments.
