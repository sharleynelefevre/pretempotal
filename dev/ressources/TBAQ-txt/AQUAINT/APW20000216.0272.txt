Elian's Father Wants Update on Son.

HAVANA (AP) --

Elian Gonzalez's father said#e1 in a letter published#e2 Wednesday#t1 that he wants#e3 Cuban diplomats based in Washington to meet#e5 with his 6-year-old son in Miami and check#e61 on his condition.

``We are worried not only about his prolonged kidnapping#e62,'' Juan Miguel Gonzalez wrote#e6 in a letter published#e7 on the front page of the Communist Party daily#t2 Granma. ``We lack#e8 direct information about the concrete conditions to which he is subjected#e9 in his daily#t3 life.''

There was no immediate response#e63 from the U.S. government to the request#e64. It was likely to be opposed#e10 by Elian's Miami relatives, who are fighting#e11 to keep#e12 the boy in the United States and who have said#e13 they think#e14 Gonzalez is being controlled by Fidel Castro's government.

Hundreds of former fighters in the revolution#e65 that brought#e16 Castro to power 42#t4>years#t4>ago#t4 gathered#e17 Wednesday#t5>night#t5 to denounce#e18 the Miami ``worms'' who support#e19 Elian's being kept#e20 in the United States.

With Castro and other historic revolutionary leaders sitting#e21 in the front row of Havana's Conventions Palace, a string of former guerrillas called#e22 for the return#e68 of ``our Elian'' to his father on the communist island.

Gonzalez had written#e23 a letter earlier this#t6>week#t6 to Attorney General Janet Reno, demanding#e24 Elian be returned#e25 to him and saying#e26 he did not recognize#e85 the courts hearing#e27 the custody battle#e70. The Justice Department said#e28 it was reviewing#e29 that letter.

Gonzalez's second letter to Reno in#s1 two#t7>weeks#t7 was published#e30 in Granma on#s2 Tuesday#t8.

``I formally object#e31 to the legal moves#e71 made or being made by those who are arbitrarily retaining#e34 Elian,'' Gonzalez said#e35 in the letter, dated#e36 Monday#t9.

In the letter, Gonzalez said#e37 he does not recognize#e86 the jurisdiction of the U.S. court system, which is weighing an attempt#e73 by Elian's Miami relatives to block#e38 his return#e74 to Cuba.

Elian has been the focus of an international custody battle#e76 since he was found#e39 on an inner tube off the Florida coast on#s3 Nov.#t10>25#t10. The boy's mother and 10 other people died#e87 when their boat sank#e40 on the way from Cuba to the United States.

Elian is staying with his paternal great-uncle Lazaro Gonzalez, who is fighting#e42 to keep#e43 the boy with him in the United States. Cuban exiles in Miami say#e44 the boy's mother died#e88 to give#e45 him freedom in the United States, while the Cuban government maintains#e46 Elian is being improperly kept#e47 from his father.

``Juan Miguel must not have written#e48 the letter himself,'' said#e49 Armando Gutierrez, spokesman for Elian's relatives in Miami. ``Castro must be dreaming#e50 for the family to allow#e51 Cuban spies inside Lazaro Gonzalez's home.''

Lawyers for the relatives in Miami filed#e52 a brief in federal court on#s4 Monday#t11 arguing#e53 the Immigration and Naturalization Service cannot return#e54 Elian to Cuba without holding#e55 a political asylum hearing#e81.

U.S. government lawyers have moved#e56 to dismiss#e57 the Miami relatives' lawsuit, arguing#e58 that they have no legal standing in the boy's case. The INS ruled#e59 last#t12>month#t12 that only Elian's father has the right to speak#e60 for the boy in immigration matters.
