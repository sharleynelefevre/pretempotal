Paying tribute, Albright visits bombing sites in East Africa.

NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _

U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright paid#e1 tribute Tuesday#t1 to bombing#e92 victims and embassy staffers on a whirlwind visit#e93 to East Africa, and promised#e2 to track#e3 down the perpetrators.

``Together, we promise#e4 to bring#e5 to justice the murderers of our friends,'' she told#e6 American and Tanzanian workers at the bomb-hit U.S. Embassy in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania.

Officials in Tanzania and Kenya, where she arrived#e8 next, also hoped#e9 she would produce#e10 new aid for their countries, where the Aug.#t2>7#t2 terrorist blasts#e97 killed#e11 257 people in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam.

FBI agents, meanwhile, pushed#e12 ahead with their all-out investigation into the bombings#e99. Contrary to other reports, the FBI and Kenyan police said#e13 Monday#t3 that a suspect who was returned#e14 from Pakistan had not admitted#e150 any role in the crimes#e102 or implicated#e151 anyone else after#s1 three#t4>days#t4 of questioning#e15.

Albright, arriving#e16 after#s5 a 16-hour#t9 flight#e103, spent#e17 about five#t5>hours#t5 in Tanzania before#s2 heading#e18 to Nairobi in a small plane when an engine of the Boeing 747 she had flown#e19 in from Washington overheated#e153.

She was scheduled#e20 to lay#e21 flowers at the bombed embassy, talk#e23 to Kenyan embassy guards and others who survived#e24 the blast#e106 and meet#e25 with President Daniel arap Moi in a five-hour#t10 visit#e107 before#s3 returning#e26 home.

In Dar es Salaam, she laid#e27 a wreath next to the crater left#e28 by the embassy blast#e108 that killed#e29 10 people. Then she handed#e30 a folded American flag to U.S. Marines and, wearing#e32 a white construction hard hat, toured#e33 the damage inside.

Reporters also were allowed#e34 inside for the first time since the explosion#e111 and found#e35 broken glass and smashed furniture scattered throughout the embassy.

Albright helped#e39 hang#e40 a poster advertising a reward of up to dlrs 2 million for information leading to the bombers' arrest#e113.

She then lavished#e43 praise, and the State Department's award for heroism, on embassy staffers before#s4 meeting#e116 with bombing victims at the Muhimbili Medical Center and with government officials.

``America is very proud of you, all of you _ Americans and Tanzanians,'' she told#e44 the staffers. ``I am truly in the presence of heroes.''

Albright announced#e45 a gift of 500 pounds (225 kilograms) of medical supplies to Tanzania and Kenya from the Walter Reed Army Medical Center. She also pledged#e46 to ask#e47 Congress to approve#e48 a still-undetermined amount of emergency funding to pay#e49 for re-establishing embassy operations in Tanzania and Kenya and to compensate#e51 victims' families.

Officials in the two African countries are counting#e52 on substantial compensation along with assurances of aid for the governments, whose key tourism industries were dealt#e53 a blow by the bombings#e130.

But Tanzanian Foreign Minister Jakaya Kikwete, speaking#e54 at a joint news conference#e131 with Albright, said#e55 there are no ill feelings in Tanzania toward Americans because of their handling of the rescue#e134, as there are among some Kenyans.

``The bomb blast#e135 has not generated#e56 any hatred against ... Americans in Tanzania,'' he said#e57. ``We are friends.''

He also urged#e58 Albright to tell#e59 Americans that Tanzania is safe and they should continue#e60 visiting#e61 and investing#e62 in the country.

Albright told#e63 the foreign minister the American people share in the profound sorrow of the Tanzanians and said#e65 the United States will maintain#e66 its presence throughout Africa and throughout the world.

``These bombings#e137 will not cause#e67 America to back#e68 down or retreat#e138,'' she declared#e69.

The head of the FBI investigation#e139 in Dar es Salaam, Kenneth Piernick, said#e70 the bureau has questioned#e71 more than 100 people there, but indicated#e72 that most of the interrogations#e140 had led#e73 nowhere.

``Right now#t6 my evidence is scant, and I'm not going to draw#e75 conclusions#e141 based on that,'' he said#e77. He would not elaborate#e78, or comment#e79 on whether two suspects remained in detention, as was previously reported#e81.

In Nairobi, a top Kenyan police official denied#e82 a newspaper report that more arrests#e144 had been made#e152 there. Officials said#e84 last#t7>week#t7 that six people were in custody for questioning#e85 about the bombing#e146.

About 200 Americans _ nonessential U.S. Embassy staff and their families _ left#e86 Pakistan today#t8 on orders from Washington following a ``pattern of threats'' against Americans there since the Africa bombings#e149. The diplomats were flown#e88 to Brussels, Belgium. Other Americans have also been urged#e89 to leave#e90.
