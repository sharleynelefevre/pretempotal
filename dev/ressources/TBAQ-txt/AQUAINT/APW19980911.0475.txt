DAR ES SALAAM, Tanzania (AP) _

Tanzania expelled#e1 five Iraqis and a Libyan who were questioned#e2 by the FBI and police in connection of the bombing#e38 of two U.S. embassies in East Africa last#t1>month#t1, a newspaper reported#e3 Friday#t2.

Immigration officials escorted#e4 the Libyan, Atif Issa Enhamed, to the airport and put#e5 him on a flight#e39 to an undisclosed Middle East destination, said#e6 Uhuru, or Freedom, a Swahili newspaper owned by the ruling Chama Cha Mapinduzi party.

Five Iraqis, whose names were not disclosed#e8, also were deported#e9, the newspaper said#e10.

It gave#e11 no reason for the expulsions#e40 and Tanzania's criminal investigation and immigration departments could not be reached#e12 for comment.

Nearly simultaneous bombings#e44 at U.S. embassies in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, and Nairobi, Kenya, on#s1 Aug.#t3>7#t3 killed#e13 258 people, including 12 Americans, and injured#e53 more than 5,500 people. Of those killed#e15, 11 were killed#e16 in Tanzania.

Two key suspects in the Kenya bombing#e45 have been handed#e17 over to the United States for trial#e46. American authorities allege#e18 the attacks#e47 were plotted by Saudi terrorist Osama bin Laden.

On#s2 Sunday#t4, Tanzanian police and FBI agents said#e19 they had made ``extraordinary discoveries#e54,'' having determined#e21 what the Dar es Salaam bomb was made of and who carried#e23 it to the embassy. They refused#e24 to provide#e25 details.

Media reports in Tanzania have said#e26 the ingredients for the bombs had originated#e27 in the Middle East and were transferred#e28 by sea via the Comoro Islands to Tanzania.

Reports in Kenya said#e29 the components of the bomb that exploded#e30 in Nairobi were transported#e31 by road from Tanzania to Kenya.

The East African nations share#e32 a long and mostly unguarded border.

On#s3 Sept.#t5>2#t5, police in the Comoros archipelago, off the Tanzanian coast, raided#e33 two homes and searched#e34 for a suspect in the bombings#e51 identified as Abdallah Mohammed Fadhul, a Comorian Muslim who had lived with his wife in Sudan until shortly after the bombings#e52.
