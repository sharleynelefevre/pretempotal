UNITED NATIONS (AP) _

The Security Council condemned#e1 the bombing#e16 of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania on#s1 Thursday#t1 and called#e2 on all states to cooperate#e3 with authorities in finding#e4 those responsible.

A resolution#e17, co-sponsored by Kenya, Tanzania and the United States and unanimously adopted#e5, ``expresses#e6 its deep sorrow, sympathy and condolences to the families of the innocent victims of the terrorist bomb attacks#e18 at this difficult time.''

It strongly condemns#e7 the ``terrorist bomb attacks#e19.'' And it stresses#e8 that every nation ``has the duty to refrain#e33 from organizing#e9, instigating#e10, assisting#e11 or participating#e12 in terrorist acts in another state.''

The almost simultaneous attacks#e23 Aug.#t2>7#t2 at the U.S. embassies in Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, killed#e13 257 people and injured#e34 more than 5,500.

``The incidents#e24 of Aug.#t3>7#t3 underscore that terrorists know no boundaries, and that the suppression#e25 of international terrorism, the arrest#e27, the conviction#e28 and the punishment#e29 of its perpetrators are essential to the maintenance#e31 of international peace and security,'' said#e15 the U.S. Deputy Ambassador Peter Burleigh.
