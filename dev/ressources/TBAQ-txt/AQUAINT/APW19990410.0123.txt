Rifle Found Near Dead Doctor's Home



AMHERST, N.Y. (AP) --

A rifle found#e1 near the home of a slain abortion doctor may yield#e2 important clues for investigators trying#e3 to track#e4 down the gunman.

Dr. Barnett Slepian was killed#e5 in his kitchen by a sniper's bullet last#t2>fall#t2. Investigators said#e6 Friday#t3 they found#e7 a rifle buried#e8 near his home in the Buffalo suburb of Amherst.

The gun was sent#e9 to the FBI laboratory in Washington to determine#e10 whether it was used#e11 to kill#e12 Slepian.

``If it's#e13 not too badly rusted, they may be able#e14 to match#e15 the bullet back to the weapon,'' said#e16 Walter Rowe, forensics sciences professor at George Washington University.

The rifle might also have#e17 clothing fibers, fingerprints or a serial number that can be traced#e18 to the buyer, Rowe said#e19.

Buried#e20 a foot beneath the ground, the weapon was unearthed#e21 during#s1 a search#e22 of a heavily wooded, four-acre area Thursday#t4. Investigators did not say#e23 how close the weapon was#e24 to the house.

Anti-abortion protester James Kopp is being sought#e25 as a material witness in the shooting#e26.

Investigators said#e27 Kopp's car was seen#e28 in the neighborhood in#s2 the days#t5 before#s3 the slaying#e29. Kopp vanished#e30 after#s4 the shooting#e31, and the car was found#e32 abandoned#e33 at the Newark, N.J., airport in#s5 December#t6.

Officials said#e34 DNA test results showed#e35 a likelihood that a strand of hair discovered#e36 behind Slepian's home came#e37 from Kopp.
