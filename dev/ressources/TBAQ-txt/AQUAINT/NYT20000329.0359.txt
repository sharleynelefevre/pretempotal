MIAMI AREA POLITICIANS CAUTION U.S. ON FORCIBLY TAKING CUBAN BOY.

MIAMI _

Elected officials in and around Miami warned#e1 U.S. immigration officials Wednesday#t1 that they should expect#e2 little help from the police here when they come#e3 for 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez, and they said#e4 this city could erupt#e5 in violence if federal agents tried#e6 to forcibly take#e7 the boy from his great-uncle's house in Little Havana and send#e8 him back to Cuba.

``We will not lend#e9 our respective resources, whether they be in the form of police officers or any other resources, to assist#e10 the federal government in any way, shape or form to inappropriately repatriate#e11 Elian Gonzalez to Cuba,'' said#e12 Alex Penelas, mayor of Miami-Dade County.

As of Wednesday#t2>evening#t2, Lazaro Gonzalez, the boy's great-uncle and temporary guardian, still had not signed#e13 an agreement to hand#e14 the child over to immigration officials if the Miami relatives lose#e15 a fight#e62 to keep#e16 him when the case is heard#e17 in#s1 May#t3 in the 11th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals.

``I won't cooperate#e18 in anything,'' Gonzalez told#e19 a Spanish-language television station. ``The boy lives in my house, and they'll have to go#e20 find#e21 him there.''

As pressure built#e22 in this city, the home of a large number of Cuban exiles, officials of the Immigration and Naturalization Service said#e23 they did not plan#e24 to remove#e25 Elian on#s2 Thursday#t4>morning#t4 even if his Miami relatives continued#e26 to defy#e72 them. But an INS spokeswoman said#e27 the agency would revoke#e28 Elian's permission to stay#e29 in the United States, clearing#e67 the way for his return#e68 to Cuba.

In Havana, Cuban President Fidel Castro said#e30 that the boy's father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, would travel#e31 to the United States to bring#e32 his son home after#s3 the custody battle#e70 has been decided#e73 in the courts. Elian's father would be accompanied#e33 by other family members from Cuba, some of the boy's former classmates and teachers, and psychiatric experts, Castro said#e34 on Cuban television.

``We have the perfect formula for reinserting#e35 Elian,'' Castro said#e36. He also said#e37 that the group would be willing to wait#e38 as long as it takes to bring#e40 the boy back.

Asked to comment#e41 on Castro's announcement#e71, a Justice Department spokesman said#e42:

``Certainly it changes#e43 things. How it changes#e44 things is a little hard to say#e45 at this point. If the father shows#e46 up in Miami and decides to go#e47 and ring#e48 the doorbell of his relatives and find#e49 his son, well, the family in Miami is on record as saying#e50 they would turn#e51 over Elian to him. Whether they actually do#e52 this remains to be seen#e74.''
