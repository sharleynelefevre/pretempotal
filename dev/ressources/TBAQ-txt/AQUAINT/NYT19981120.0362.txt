ANTIABORTION ACTIVIST MAY BE IN MEXICO.

The antiabortion activist wanted#e1 for questioning#e2 in last#t2>month#t2's shooting death#e3 of a doctor in a Buffalo suburb may have fled#e4 to Mexico, according to a newspaper report.

James Charles Kopp, 44, of Vermont, was seen#e5 in the car of a female associate crossing#e6 the US border days#t7 after#s1 a sniper killed#e7 Dr. Barnett Slepian in his kitchen, the Buffalo News reported#e8 Friday#t3.

Kopp has been#e9 the subject of a manhunt following reports that he was spotted#e10 in a vehicle near the scene of the Oct.#t4>23#t4 slaying#e11 of Slepian, 52, an obstetrician who also performed#e12 abortions. The FBI says#e13 Kopp is wanted#e14 as a material witness in the case.

Friday#t5, an FBI official said#e15 authorities are pursuing#e16 more than 400 tips but have not pinned#e17 down Kopp's whereabouts.

``In all candor, the FBI does not know#e18 where James Kopp is#e19 _ period,'' said#e20 Paul Moskal, a spokesman for the bureau's Buffalo office. ``He's as likely to be#e21 in Boston, Massachusetts, as in Buffalo, New York.''

Authorities want#e22 to question#e23 the unidentified woman who allegedly traveled#e24 with Kopp, according to an investigator quoted#e25 by the newspaper.

``She may have been#e26 with Kopp sometime after#s2 the murder#e27,'' the investigator said#e28. ``Kopp may be#e29 in Mexico. He may have even traveled#e30 further into Central America or South America.''

A task force of US and Canadian officials is investigating#e31 the similarities between the attack#e32 on Slepian and four others#e38 on abortion providers in Canada and upstate New York in#s3 the past four#t6>years#t6.

The US Justice Department is offering#e33 a $500,000 reward for information leading#e34 to the arrest#e35 and conviction#e36 of those responsible for Slepian's slaying#e37.
