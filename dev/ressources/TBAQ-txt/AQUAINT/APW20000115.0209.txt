Cuba Presses for Boy's Repatriation.

HAVANA (AP) --

While state-run television broadcast#e58 footage of Cuban exiles protesting#e2 in Miami against the repatriation#e60 of Elian Gonzalez, the Cuban government urged#e3 its people to keep#e4 up their own demonstrations#e61 to ensure#e5 the boy's return#e62.

The unusual airing of protests#e63 against President Fidel Castro appeared#e6 aimed#e7 at warning#e8 Cuban citizens that South Florida exiles could still force#e9 the reversal#e65 of the U.S. government's decision#e66 to return#e10 Gonzalez to Cuba.

Castro attended#e11 a rally#e67 Thursday#t1 by media workers at Havana's Palace of Conventions to demand#e12 Gonzalez's return#e68. For weeks#t13 the communist government has held#e13 such rallies#e69 almost daily#t2.

``The case of Elian is for today's youth what 40#t4>years#t4 of the blockade, armed invasions#e71, sabotage#e72 and attempts#e73 to kill#e14 President Fidel Castro were for earlier generations,'' said#e15 Cuban journalist Luis Baez, who has written#e16 several books about Cuban emigration to the United States.

After#s1 the rally#e76, state television showed#e17 the Cuban exiles in the streets of Miami -- some of them carrying#e18 signs demanding#e19 ``Freedom for Elian,'' the same battle cry regularly chanted#e20 during#s2 rallies#e82 on this side of the Florida Straits.

A voiceover to the footage called#e21 the exiles ``criminals'' and ``mafia members.''

Hundreds of Cuban-Americans chanting#e22 ``Liberty! Liberty!'' blocked#e23 intersections and cut#e24 off access to the Port of Miami. In one case, riot police had to use#e25 tear gas to clear#e27 them.

Saying ``nothing is certain'' about Elian's return#e88, Cuba's government exhorted#e28 citizens to keep#e29 rallying#e30, after#s3 the boy's relatives in Miami said#e31 they would look#e32 for ways to get#e33 around Wednesday#t5's ruling#e89 by the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service to repatriate#e34 the child by#s4 Jan.#t6>14#t6.

Cuban exiles in Miami will now#t7 ``proceed#e103 with all their resources to impede#e104 or delay#e35'' the ruling#e91, Cuba predicted#e36 Wednesday#t8.

``We cannot stop#e37 mobilizing#e38! The struggle must not stop#e39 for one#t9>minute#t9!'' said#e40 a message that was read#e41 Wednesday#t10>night#t10 to several thousand rallying#e42 Cuban scientists.

Rescued#e106 on#s5 Nov.#t11>25#t11 by fishermen off the Florida coast, Elian has become#e43 the subject of an international custody battle#e97.

His mother died#e105 in a boating accident#e98 trying#e45 to get#e46 Elian and herself to the United States. The boy's father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, lives in Cuba and wants#e47 Elian back.

But Elian's relatives in Miami have fought#e48 to keep#e49 the boy, saying#e50 they could provide#e51 him with a better life. Since the INS decision#e100 was announced#e52 Wednesday#t12, they have said#e53 they will appeal#e54 the decision#e101.

Gonzalez has not appeared#e55 publicly since the announcement#e102. Neither he nor Elian's four grandparents could be located#e56 in their hometown of Cardenas, east of Havana.
