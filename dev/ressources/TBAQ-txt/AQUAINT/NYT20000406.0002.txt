EDITORIAL: THE QUEST OF JUAN GONZALEZ.

The New York Times said#e1 in an editorial on Thursday#t1>April#t1>6#t1:

Juan Miguel Gonzalez has made#e2 the right decision#e54 to travel#e3 to the United States on#s1 Thursday#t2 to affirm#e4 his desire to be reunited#e85 with his son, Elian. His presence on American soil is necessary to dispel#e86 doubts about his fitness as a father _ raised#e5 maliciously by Elian's Miami relatives _ and to end#e6 speculation#e57 that he is indifferent about reclaiming#e87 custody of his son. With Gonzalez all but out of sight in Cuba, the relatives have had a free hand to distort#e7 the case with bogus legal arguments and unsubstantiated claims#e8 that Elian is afraid to see#e9 his father.

The relatives are obviously fond of Elian, though their judgment has clearly been clouded#e88 by their animosity toward Fidel Castro, the Cuban leader. Once Gonzalez comes#e10 to the United States _ it would be preferable if he went#e11 to Miami rather than to Washington _ only the most obdurate foes of Castro can argue#e12 that Elian should not be reunited#e89 with him. Gonzalez's arrival#e62 should also help#e13 clear#e14 the way for the Justice Department to make#e15 arrangements#e63 to transfer#e16 custody of the child.

The Miami relatives have left#e17 unclear whether they will willingly relinquish#e18 custody of Elian, and have done their best to stir#e19 passions against the Justice Department among Cuban-Americans in South Florida. In hopes of trumping#e20 the law, they have unreasonably demanded#e21 that a panel of child psychologists determine#e22 Elian's fate. The best outcome#e68 would be for the relatives to turn#e23 Elian over to his father as soon as Gonzalez arrives#e24, and to do#e25 so in a spirit of kinship that makes#e26 the transition#e69 as smooth as possible for Elian. Once that happens#e27, Gonzalez and Elian, though technically free to return#e28 to Cuba, should remain here to await#e90 an appellate court ruling#e70 on the case, which is expected#e30 next#t5>month#t5.

But if the relatives balk#e31, the Justice Department should quickly revoke#e32 their custody of the child and obtain#e33 a federal court order#e72 instructing#e34 them and their lawyers to turn#e35 Elian over to his father. The relatives may be less defiant if they are held#e36 in contempt of court.

If a court edict#e74 fails#e37 to compel#e91 compliance#e75, the Justice Department will have to consider#e38 sterner measures, for the relatives will then be resisting#e39 the rule of law as defined#e40 by both the department and the courts. But Washington ought not to rush#e41 to take#e42 Elian forcibly from the relatives. That course would be psychologically wounding to the boy, and could lead#e44 to a violent confrontation#e78 with demonstrators who gather#e45 daily#t6 outside the relatives' home. The government yields#e79 none of its legal or moral authority in the case if it gives#e46 the relatives and their supporters time to reflect#e47 and to look#e48 for a gentler resolution#e80.

As a matter of law, compassion and common sense, the government is entitled to reunite#e92 Elian with his father, and it has the power to enforce#e49 that right, despite the bluster of Miami's demagogic political leaders. But for now#t7, everyone involved should be searching#e51 for an amicable ending#e82. Juan Gonzalez is doing#e52 his part by making#e53 the short journey#e83 across the Florida Straits to erase#e93 any question about his love for his son.
