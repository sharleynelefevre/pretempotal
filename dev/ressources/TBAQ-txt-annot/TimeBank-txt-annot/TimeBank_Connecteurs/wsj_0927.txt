Assets as#29#0 of Sept.#t113>30#t113 fell#e54 to  $  2.46 billion from about  $  2.77 billion.`` We will have#e55 a reasonably flat year this#t122>year#t122, ''Mr. Schwarz says#e56. Mr. Schwarz also#8#Expansion said#e57 costs associated with U.S. Trust's planned move to midtown Manhattan from Wall Street will continue#e60 to be a drag#e2370 on earnings through 1990#t116.
