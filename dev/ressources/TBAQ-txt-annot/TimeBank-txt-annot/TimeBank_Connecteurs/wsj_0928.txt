X X X @ Posts 1st-Quarter Net @ Totaling  $  5.2 Million 10/26/89 WALL STREET JOURNAL (J) SUNW EARNINGS (ERN) COMPUTERS AND#19#0 INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (CPR) MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. Sun Microsystems Inc., snapping#e1 back to profitability after#5#0 its first quarterly loss#e2 as#24#0 a public firm, said#e4 it earned#e5  $  5.2 million, or#25#0 seven cents a share, in the#t64>fiscal#t64>first#t64>quarter#t64. Sun, a maker of computer workstations, reported#e6 sales of  $  538.5 million for#12#0 the#t68>quarter#t68 ended Sept.#t69>29#t69, up 39 % from  $  388.5 million a#t73>year#t73>earlier#1#0#t73. In the#t74>1988#t74>period#t74, the company earned#e8  $  20.6 million, or#26#0 26 cents a share. Sun's results were slightly better than expectations. Earlier#2#0 this#t77>month#t77, the company said#e10 it expected#e11 to break#e13 even for#13#0 the#t78>quarter#t78 on sales of  $  530 million. In a statement, Scott McNealy, Sun's NX chief executive officer, said#e16 the company's performance was hampered#e18 by problems tied to the introduction#e20 of a major new family of computers in April#t83. One of those new computers, called Sparcstation 1, accounted#e239 for#14#0 nearly half of the 28,000 systems Sun shipped#e23 in the#t84>quarter#t84, he said#e24. More than two-thirds of the systems shipped#e25, meanwhile#0#0, were products introduced#e26 in April#t87. But#11#Comparison problems in manufacturing, forecasting demand and#20#0 getting the bugs out of a new management information system made#e32 it extremely difficult for#15#0 Sun to meet#e34 demand for#16#0 its newest computers well into the#t89>summer#t89. These problems also#6#Expansion resulted#e36 in Sun reporting#e37 a  $  20.3 million loss#e38 for#17#0 its#t94>fourth#t94>quarter#t94 ended June#t95>30#t95. Mr. McNealy said#e40 the issues that hurt#e41 Sun's performance earlier#3#0 this#t96>year#t96 are now ''largely ''behind the firm, and#21#0 he indicated#e44 that Sun's profitability should increase#e45 throughout the#t99>fiscal#t99>year#t99. Sun also#7#Expansion reported#e47 a record backlog of orders. While#4#0 this indicates continued strong demand#e50 for#18#0 the company's desk-top computers, Sun faces#e51 increasing competition from Digital Equipment Corp. and#22#0 Hewlett-Packard Co. Recently#t101, analysts have said#e54 Sun also#8#Expansion is vulnerable#e102 to competition from International Business Machines Corp., which plans#e56 to introduce#e58 a group of workstations early#t103>next#9#0#t103>year#t103, and#23#0 Next#10#0 Inc.
