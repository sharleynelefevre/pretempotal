OTC Focus: X X @ Sell Programs @ Are Hurting X @ Market Makers @-- X X @ By Sonja Steptoe and#40#0 Craig Smith X X X @ Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal 10/30/89 WALL STREET JOURNAL (J) STOCK MARKET, OFFERINGS (STK) STOCK INDEXES (NDX) SECURITIES INDUSTRY (SCR) NEW YORK Market makers in Nasdaq over-the-counter stocks are adding#e1 their voices to the swelling chorus of complaints about program trading. Their motivation, however#9#Comparison, has a strong practical aspect: Program trading is hazardous to their paychecks. The most controversial form of program trading, stock-index arbitrage, is ''making#e298 it tough for#60#0 traders to make money, ''declares#e297 Robert Antolini, head of OTC trading at Donaldson, Lufkin amp Jenrette. Stock-index arbitrage#e17-- the computer-guided buying and#41#0 selling of stocks with offsetting trades in stock-index futures to profit from fleeting price discrepancies-- affects#e25 the OTC market directly through the 31 stocks included in Standard amp Poor's 500-stock index. The SampP 500 is often used in arbitrage strategies. The portion of OTC volume attributable to program trading isn't known, as#77#0 it is on the New York Stock Exchange, where it amounted#e34 to more than 13 % in September#t295. Estimates#e35 from traders put it at less than 5 % of Nasdaq's average daily volume of roughly 133 million shares. Other market-maker gripes: Program trading#e38 also#27#Expansion causes#e39 the Nasdaq Composite Index to lose#e41 ground against other segments of the stock market. Because#3#0 of program trading#e43 it is more difficult#e299 to trade#e45 many OTC stocks without sharp price moves#e46, a condition known as#78#0 illiquidity. Moreover#2#Expansion, the price volatility#e302 that is amplified#e48 by program trading#e49 is undercutting#e50 efforts#e51 to woo#e53 individual investors back to an OTC market that sorely misses#e55 them. Some of these problems#e547 are neither#8#0 new nor#8#0 unique to the OTC market. But#55#Comparison the big, often tumultuous slide#e57 in stock prices this#t303>month#t303 has turned#e58 some of those who have been profiting#e59 from the practice against it. Peter DaPuzzo, head of retail equity trading at Shearson Lehman Hutton, acknowledges#e63 that he wasn't troubled#e305 by program trading#e64 when#29#0 it began#e66 in the pre-crash bull market because#4#Contingency it added#e69 liquidity and#42#0 people were pleased#e308 to see#e71 stock prices rising#e72.`` We weren't as#79#0 concerned until#17#Temporal they became#e75 sell programs, ''says#e76 Mr. DaPuzzo, who now#t311 thinks#e77 it adds#e78 unnecessary volatility. Shearson Lehman, however#10#Comparison, executes program trades for#61#0 clients. Merrill Lynch, Goldman Sachs and#43#0 Kidder Peabody, in#1#0 addition#1#0 to Shearson, do program-trade OTC stocks. Shearson, Merrill Lynch and#44#0 Goldman Sachs say they do so#76#0 only for#62#0 customers, however#11#0. Kidder Peabody does program trading for#63#0 its own as#12#0 well#12#0 as#80#0 clients NX accounts. Of course, there were sell programs#e318 in past#t320>years#t320, too, but#56#0 they seem#e90 to hurt#e92 market makers more painfully these#t321>days#t321. That's largely because#5#Contingency of defensive measures they adopted#e94 after#18#0 the 1987#t323 crash#e95, when#30#0 individual investors fled#e98 the market and#45#0 trading activity dwindled#e101. Market makers, to cut#e103 costs, slashed#e104 inventories of stocks they keep on hand to sell investors when#31#0 other holders aren't selling. And#46#Expansion to protect#e114 their reduced capital investment from eroding#e117 further#7#0, market makers became quicker to lower#e324 price quotes when#32#0 sell programs are in#e1093 progress. On days when#33#0 prices are tumbling, they must be willing#e326 to buy#e127 shares from sellers when#34#0 no one else#26#0 will. In such an environment, market makers can suffer#e130 huge losses#e327 both on trades made that day at steadily dropping prices and#47#0 in the value of their inventories of shares.`` It makes#e329 no sense#e140 for#64#0 us to put#e142 money at risk when#35#0 you know#e147 you're going to lose, ''says#e151 Mr. Antolini, of Donaldson Lufkin. But#57#Comparison this skittishness#e330, Mr. Antolini says, is creating#e153 liquidity problems#e331 in certain OTC stocks.`` It's harder to sell stocks when#36#0 the sell programs come in because#6#Contingency some market makers don't want to -LCB- take the orders -RCB-. No one has big positions and#48#0 no one wants to take big risks. ''Joseph Hardiman, president of the National Association of Securities Dealers, which oversees trading on Nasdaq, agrees#e171 that program trading is hurting#e173 the market's efforts#e175 to bring#e177 back small investors. But#58#Comparison, he observes#e178, while#24#0 makers suffer#e180 losses#e333 when#37#0 program trading drags#e184 the market down, they also#28#Expansion make#e185 money when#38#0 program trading pushes#e190 the prices higher.`` Sometimes -LCB- traders -RCB- lose#e191 sight of that, ''he says#e193. The OTC stocks in the SampP 500 include Nasdaq's biggest, such as#81#0 Apple Computer, MCI Communications, Tele-Communications and#49#0 Liz Claiborne. These big stocks greatly influence the Nasdaq Composite Index. When#39#Contingency the computers say `` sell, ''the composite tumbles as#13#0 well#13#0 as#82#0 the Dow Jones Industrial Average. The problem, market makers say, is that while#25#0 the industrial average and#50#0 the SampP 500 usually recover as#83#0 buy programs kick in, the Nasdaq Composite frequently is left behind. Eight#t336>trading#t336>days#t336 after#19#0 Oct.#t335>12#t335, the#t338>day#t338 before#16#0 the stock market plunge#e205, for#0#0 instance#0#0, the Nasdaq Composite had fallen#e208 4.3 %, compared with 3.3 % for#65#0 the SampP 500, 3.5 % for#66#0 the New York Stock Exchange Composite Index and#51#0 3.6 % for#67#0 the industrial average. This gap eventually closes#e210, but#59#0 slowly. Three#t341>days#t341 later#23#Temporal, as#84#0 of Friday#t340's close#e211, the Nasdaq Composite was down 6 %, compared with 5.9 % for#68#0 the industrial average, 5.7 % for#69#0 the SampP 500 and#52#0 5.8 % for#70#0 the Big Board Composite. The main reason for#71#0 this lag#e214 is that individual investors own#e345 65 % of the OTC market's capitalization, according#e346 to Mr. Hardiman, much more than on the Big Board. Such investors tend to be more cautious than institutional investors are about re-entering the market after#20#0 massive selloffs, market makers say. The Nasdaq Composite Index tumbled#e223 5.39, or#86#0 1.2 % to 452.76 on Friday#t356. For#72#0 the#t357>week#t357, the index dropped#e225 3.8 %. Weakness#e358 in big technology stocks hurt#e227 the composite as#14#0 well#14#0 as#85#0 the Nasdaq 100 Index, which fell#e228 1.4 %, or#87#0 6.43, on Friday#t362, to 437.68. The Nasdaq Financial Index lost#e229 about 1 %, or#88#0 3.95, to 448.80. Friday#t365's trading volume totaled#e230 132.8 million shares. The average daily share turnover for#73#0 October#t366 is almost 148 million shares. LIN Broadcasting surged#e231 4, 5/8 to 112, 5/8; LIN and#53#0 BellSouth sweetened#e232 their merger agreement in an attempt#e234 to keep#e237 shareholders from tendering#e239 their shares to McCaw Cellular Communications. McCaw, which dropped#e240 2, 1/2 to 37, 3/4, has offered#e241  $  125 a share for#74#0 a majority of LIN's shares. The revised LIN-BellSouth agreement boosts#e243 the dollar amount of the special dividend LIN promises to pay shareholders. LIN now#t368 plans#e247 to dole#e249 out  $  42 a share in cash, up from the earlier#15#0  $  20 amount. Intel eased#e252 1/8 to 31, 7/8. The semiconductor concern said#e253 the interruption#e254 in shipment#e371 of its 80486 computer chip will be brief#e372 and#54#0 have#e373 little impact#e256 on the company's earnings. The stock fell#e257 7/8 Thursday#t1082 amid concerns#e1085 over problems discovered with the chip. Intel told#e259 analysts that the company will resume#e260 shipments#e261 of the chips within two#t1111>to#t1111>three#t1111>weeks#t1111. Weisfield's rocketed#e262 9, 1/2 to 39 after#21#Temporal the jewelry store operator said#e263 it is in preliminary discussions#e1091, with a party it wouldn't identify#e267, regarding the possible acquisition#e271 of the company. Starpointe Savings Bank rose#e272 3 to 20 after#22#Temporal the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. approved#e273 Dime Savings Bank of New York's  $  21-a-share acquisition#e274 of Starpointe. Kirschner Medical fell#e275 4 to 15. The company said#e276 its third-quarter#t380 earnings will probably be lower#e381 than the 16 cents a share it reported#e277 last#t387>year#t387, despite a rise#e278 in the company's revenue. Kirschner earned#e279  $  376,000 on revenue of  $  14.5 million in the#t386>1988#t386>quarter#t386. The company blamed#e280 a number of factors for#75#0 the earnings decline#e390, including softer sales#e392 of joint-implants.
