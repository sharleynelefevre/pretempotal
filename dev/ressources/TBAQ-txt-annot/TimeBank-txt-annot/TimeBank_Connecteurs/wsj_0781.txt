wsj_0781 Chip by Intel @ Contains Flaw X @ In Calculating @-- X X @ ` Bugs ''Could Stall Makers @ Of Certain Computers; X @ Most Users Unaffected @-- X @ By Stephen Kreider Yoder @ Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal 10/27/89 WALL STREET JOURNAL (J) INTC IBM CPQ SEMICONDUCTORS, INTEGRATED CHIPS (SEM) COMPUTERS AND#26#0 INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (CPR) Computer experts familiar with the flaws, found in Intel's 80486 chip, say#e10 the defects don't affect#e11 the average user and#27#0 are likely to be cleared#e14 up before#10#0 most computers using the chip as#61#0 their ''brains ''appear#e16 on the market sometime#t278>next#17#0#t278>year#t278. Intel said#e19 that last#t279>week#t279 a customer discovered#e20 two flaws in its 80486 microprocessor chip's `` floating-point unit "",, a set of circuits that do certain calculations. On Friday#t280, Intel began#e24 notifying#e25 customers about the bugs which cause#e26 the chip to give#e28 wrong answers for#46#0 some mathematical calculations. But#57#Comparison while#14#0 International Business Machines Corp. and#28#0 Compaq Computer Corp. say#e32 the bugs will delay#e33 products, most big computer makers said#e34 the flaws don't affect#e35 them.`` Bugs like this are just a normal part of product development, ''said#e38 Richard Archuleta, director of Hewlett-Packard Co.'s advanced systems development. Hewlett announced#e41 last#t281>week#t281 that it planned#e42 to ship#e44 a computer based on the 486 chip early#t282>next#18#0#t282>year#t282.`` These bugs don't affect#e46 our schedule at all, ''he said#e49. Likewise#2#0, AST Research Inc. and#29#0 Sun Microsystems Inc. said#e50 the bugs won't delay#e51 their development#e53 of 486-based machines.`` We haven't modified#e54 our schedules in any way, ''said#e59 a Sun spokesman. To switch#e61 to another vendor's chips, `` would not definitely be an option, ''he said#e65. Nonetheless#0#Comparison, concern about the chip may have been responsible for#47#0 a decline#e236 of 87.5 cents in Intel's stock to  $  32 a share yesterday#t283 in over-the-counter trading#e67, on volume of 3,609,800 shares, and#30#0 partly responsible for#48#0 a drop#e242 in Compaq's stock in New York Stock Exchange composite trading#e243 on Wednesday#t284. Yesterday#t285, Compaq plunged#e69 further#4#0, closing#e247 at  $  100 a share, off  $  8.625 a share, on volume of 2,633,700 shares. Most of Compaq's decline#e249 is being attributed#e70 to a third-quarter#t1000 earnings report that came in at the low end of analysts expectations. Intel said#e74 it had corrected#e75 the problems and#31#0 would start#e76 producing#e78 bugless chips next#19#0#t286>week#t286.`` We should not be seeing#e79 any more, ''said#e82 Bill Rash, Intel's director for#49#0 the 486 chip. What's more, the bugs only emerge#e83 on esoteric applications such as#62#0 computer-aided UCP design and#32#0 scientific calculations, he said#e88, and#33#0 then#24#0 very seldom.`` These errata do not affect#e90 business programs, ''he said#e92. The bugs will cause#e93 problems in `` specific and#34#0 rare circumstances that will not occur in typical applications ''such as#63#0 word-processing and#35#0 spreadsheets, said#e99 Michael Slater, editor of the Microprocessor Report, an industry newsletter. Sun, Hewlett-Packard and#36#0 others say#e102 Intel isn't wholly to blame for#50#0 the snafu. The real culprits, they said#e105, are computer makers such as#64#0 IBM that have jumped#e106 the gun to unveil#e108 486-based products.`` The reason this is getting so#60#0 much visibility is that some started#e111 shipping#e112 and#37#0 announced#e113 early availability, ''said#e114 Hewlett-Packard's Mr. Archuleta.`` You can do that but#58#0 you're taking a risk. Those companies are paying the price for#51#0 taking the risk. ''In late#t287>September#t287, IBM began#e122 shipping#e123 a plug-in card that converts its PS/2 model 70-A21 from a 80386 machine to an 80486 machine. An IBM spokeswoman said#e126 the company told#e127 customers Monday#t288 about the bugs and#38#0 temporarily stopped#e128 shipping#e129 the product. IBM has#e130 no plans to recall#e133 its add-on cards, the spokeswoman said#e135, and#39#0 could probably circumvent#e136 the bugs without long product delays#e138.`` We don't look#e139 at this as#65#0 a major problem for#52#0 us, ''she said#e141. Compaq, which said#e142 it discovered#e143 the bugs, still#13#0 plans#e144 to announce#e146 new 486 products on Nov.#t289>6#t289. Because#7#0 of the glitch, however#6#0, the company said#e147 it doesn't know#e148 when#23#0 its machine will be commercially available#e262. That's a break from Compaq tradition, because#8#Contingency the company doesn't announce products until#16#Temporal they're actually at the dealers. The problem is being ballyhooed#e154, experts say#e155, because#9#Contingency the 486 is Intel's future flagship. Intel's microprocessors are the chips of choice in many of today's personal computers and#40#0 the 80486 microprocessor is the spearhead of the company's bid to guard that spot in the next#20#0 generation of machines.`` Although#1#Comparison these sorts of bugs are not at all uncommon, the 486 is an extremely high-profile product, ''said#e163 Mr. Slater, the newsletter editor. Intel's 80486 chip is the Corvette of Intel's microprocessors, a super-fast, super-expensive chip that only the most power-hungry computer users are likely to buy for#53#0 at least several#t1001>years#t1001. Unveiled last#t291>April#t291, the chip crams 1.2 million transistors on a sliver of silicon, more than four times as#66#0 many as#67#0 on Intel's earlier#5#0 model, 80386. Intel clocks the chip's speed at 15 million instructions per second, or#71#0 MIPs. That's four times as#68#0 fast as#69#0 the 386. Machines using#e171 the 486 are expected#e172 to challenge#e174 higher-priced work stations and#41#0 minicomputers in applications such as#70#0 so-called servers, which connect groups of computers UCP together, and#42#0 in computer-aided design. But#59#Comparison while#15#0 the chip's speed in processing power is dazzling, it's real strength lies in its software inheritance. The 486 is the descendant of a long series of Intel chips that began#e185 dominating#e186 the market ever since#11#0 IBM picked#e188 the 16-bit 8088 chip for#54#0 its first personal computer. (A 16-bit microprocessor processes 16 pieces of data at a time and#43#0 is slower than newer, 32-bit chips.) Since#12#0 then#25#0, Intel has cornered#e192 a large part of the market with successive generations of 16-bit and#44#0 32-bit chips, all of which can run software written for#55#0 previous models. That's what will keep#e198 computer makers coming#e199 in spite of the irritation of bugs. Big personal computer makers and#45#0 many makers of engineering workstations are developing#e200 486-based machines, which are expected#e201 to reach#e203 the market early#t292>next#21#0#t292>year#t292. Of the big computer makers, only Apple Computer Co. bases its machines on Motorola chips instead#3#Expansion.`` The 486 is going to have#e210 a big impact#e273 on the industry, ''said#e213 Hewlett-Packard's Mr. Archuleta.`` It's going to be the leading edge technology in personal computers for#56#0 the#t293>next#22#0#t293>few#t293>years#t293. This bug is not going to have#e220 any affect on that at all. ''Andy Zipser in Dallas contributed to this article.
