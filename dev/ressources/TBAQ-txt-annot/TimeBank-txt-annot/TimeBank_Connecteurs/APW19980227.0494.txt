QL UR By ANNA DOLGOV QC UR Associated Press Writer QC MOSCOW (AP) _ Presidents Leonid Kuchma of Ukraine and#9#0 Boris Yeltsin of Russia signed#e1 an economic cooperation plan Friday#t2297, and#10#0 Yeltsin claimed#e2 they resolved#e3 even more nagging problems. Russia and#11#0 Ukraine share similar cultures and#12#0 languages, and#13#0 Ukraine was ruled#e4 from Moscow for#25#0 centuries#t154. But#36#Comparison while#3#0 the two Slavic neighbors see themselves as#38#0 natural partners, their relations since#4#0 the breakup#e8 of the Soviet Union have been bedeviled#e10 by a number of disputes#e11 _ Black Sea naval bases, border problems and#14#0 Ukraine's natural gas debts.`` We have covered#e12 the entire list of questions and#15#0 discussed#e15 how we will be tackling#e16 them, ''Yeltsin was quoted#e17 as#39#0 saying#e18 by the ITAR-Tass news agency.`` I must say#e20 there are no unsettled problems any more. We have solved#e22 them all. ''But#37#Comparison his sweeping statement contained no details, and#16#Expansion gave no indication of how the disputes#e28 could be resolved#e29. Their solution would require#e32 a compromise#e34 between the two nations parliaments. A major dispute#e37 concerns a broad political treaty calling for#26#0 border demarcation, which the two presidents signed#e41 last#t143>May#t143. In effect, the treaty amounts to Russian recognition of Ukraine's sovereignty and#17#0 borders, and#18#0 the Ukrainian parliament has already ratified#e43 it. However#1#Comparison, Russia has stalled#e44 ratification#e45, trying#e46 to tie#e48 it to an agreement that would permit#e50 the Russian navy to use#e53 a naval base on Ukraine's Crimean peninsula for#27#0 at#t2300>least#t2300>20#t2300>more#t2300>years#t2300. In their joint statement issued#e55 after#2#0 the talks#e56, Yeltsin and#19#0 Kuchma called#e58 for#28#0 the fastest possible ratification#e59 of the treaty, saying#e61 it would create#e62 a `` strong legal foundation ''for#29#0 bilateral ties and#20#0 help#e64 stability in Europe. Kuchma assured#e65 Yeltsin that Ukraine would not join#e66 NATO, Yeltsin's spokesman Sergei Yastrzhembsky said#e69, according#e156 to the Interfax news agency. The Russian leadership has staunchly opposed#e71 the western alliance's expansion#e72 into Eastern Europe. In their joint statement, released#e74 by the Kremlin, the two leaders also#5#Expansion pledged#e75 to consult#e77 each other regularly on their approaches to relations with NATO and#21#0, in#0#0 particular#0#0, their action within the framework of NATO's Partnership for#30#0 Peace program. Last#t146>year#t146, Russian officials assailed#e82 Ukraine for#31#0 holding#e83 joint naval exercises#e84 with NATO in the Black Sea _ an area Moscow considers its own turf. Kuchma has said#e86 repeatedly that Ukraine would remain#e87 neutral for#32#0 the foreseeable future. Yeltsin and#22#0 Kuchma also#6#Expansion called#e89 for#33#0 developing#e90 the stagnant relations between the members of the Commonwealth of Independent States, a loose coalition of former Soviet republics. In the#t149>past#t149, Russia has often claimed#e92 that Ukraine was undermining#e93 efforts at closer cooperation within the CIS. A major goal of Kuchma's four-day#t150 state visit#e98 was the signing#e158 of a 10-year#t500 economic program aimed#e99 at doubling#e101 the two nations trade turnover, which fell#e102 to dlrs 14 billion last#t2303>year#t2303, down dlrs 2.5 billion from 1996#t152. The two presidents on Friday#t151 signed#e105 the plan, which calls#e106 for#34#0 cooperation#e107 in the metallurgy, fuel, energy, aircraft building, missile, space and#23#0 chemical industries. A major project is joint manufacturing#e111 of An-70 cargo planes, the Kremlin statement said#e112. The program also#7#Expansion calls#e113 for#35#0 coordination#e114 of economic reforms and#24#0 joint improvement#e116 of social programs in the two countries, where many people have become impoverished#e118 during the chaotic post-Soviet transition#e119 to capitalism. Kuchma also#8#Expansion planned#e121 to visit#e123 Russian gas giant Gazprom, most likely to discuss#e125 Ukraine's dlrs 1.2 billion debt to the company.
