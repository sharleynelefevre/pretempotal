NYT19980424.0421 By a 6-3 vote, the court upheld#e11 a discriminatory immigration law that gives a child born overseas to an unmarried American woman a better chance at citizenship than a child born to an unmarried American man. Under the statute, a child born abroad to an unwed American mother is automatically considered a U.S. citizen. But#6#Comparison the child of an unwed American father has no citizenship rights unless#2#0 the father takes the affirmative step of acknowledging paternity and#7#0 formally agrees to provide support until#3#Temporal the child turns 18. The majority's views were expressed#e24 in three separate opinions, the most disquieting of which was written#e25 by a liberal member, Justice John Paul Stevens, and#8#0 joined#e26 by a conservative, Chief Justice William Rehnquist. The opinion, which found#e27 the gender distinction reasonable, relied#e28 heavily on outmoded generalities about family roles, including the flawed presumption that mothers have a closer relationship to their children than fathers do. As#16#0 Justice Stephen Breyer asked#e32 in a strong dissent#e33, `` what sense does it make ''to apply citizenship barriers `` only to fathers and#9#0 not to mothers in today's world _ where paternity can readily be proved and#10#0 where women and#11#0 men both are likely to earn a living in the workplace? "",. Justices Sandra Day OConnor and#12#0 Anthony Kennedy seemed to agree#e43 that the law amounted#e44 to unconstitutional sex discrimination. Butinstead of providing#e45 the votes to strike#e46 it down, they chose#e47 to uphold#e48 it on the flimsy ground that because#0#Contingency the sex of the parent and#13#0 not the child made the difference under the law, the plaintiff did not have standing to bring#e52 the case. The Justice Department, which supported#e53 the statute, did not cover#e54 itself with glory either#1#0. The department retreated#e56 from its position in the VMI case when#4#0 it argued#e59 that the government could not make#e60 policy#e2004 based on stereotypes `` even when#5#0 those stereotypes reflect#e65 current#t77 realities. ''As#17#0 for#15#0 the court, it managed#e66 with its splintered ruling to cast#e67 doubt both on the constitutionality of the immigration provisions it upheld and#14#0 on its true commitment to fighting gender stereotypes.
