PRI19980303.2000.2550 In some respects, that's typical county business, but#26#0 tomorrow#t139's vote#e8 has international implications. The board will decide#e10 whether the Islamic Saudi Academy, funded#e11 by the government of Saudi Arabia, can move#e12 to Ashburn village, Virginia. But#27#Comparison local residents have not exactly laid#e14 out the red carpet for#19#0 their would be neighbors. The World's Nancy Marshalll has#e3000 our story. Inside the Islamic Saudi academy in Mount Vernon, Virginia, many of the girls wear head scarves and#4#0 some of the neatly dressed children are in uniforms. The instruction is in English for#20#0 most classes, in Arabic for#21#0 language and#5#0 religious studies. The school says it teaches the children to be good Muslims and#6#0 good students. They're learning a civics lesson from the residents of Loudon county. The Islamic Saudi Academy has twelve hundred mostly American students but#28#0 would take#e29 thirty-five hundred if#32#0 it had#e32 the room. The academy bought#e33 a hundred acres in Loudon county, Virginia, and#7#0 asked#e34 for#22#0 permission to build#e37 a fifty million dollar campus. In the nearby suburban housing tracts, someone dropped#e38 off leaflets warning#e39 the school could bring#e40 thousands of Middle Eastern strangers and#8#0 terrorists. Some residents of the mostly white, mostly middle class area became#e42 alarmed. James Zogby of the Arab American Institute says#e147 it's a familiar story. There is, X a- at a very deep level in our culture, um I think#e146, a sense of, of ignorance about Islam, a fear about who Muslims are and#9#0 what they're doing. Many local residents denounced#e50 the bigotry, but#29#0 opposition to the school then#2#0 shifted#e52. Now#t346 critics of the academy are targeting#e53 its owner, the Saudi government. Pastor James Allmen of the fellowship church and#10#0 school in Ashburn has led#e54 the anti-Saudi campaign#e55. James Allmen says#e56 he has#e57 no problem with a privately funded academy, but#30#0 he has#e59 a big problem with a Saudi funded school. The Saudi Arabian government has an atrocious record on human rights and#11#0 is known to be one of the worst offending countries when#1#0 it comes to religious persecution. That's correct. And#12#Expansion that is a condition of the application, then#3#0. At a public hearing#e69 on the Islamic Saudi Academy's application, the split#e71 in county opinion was obvious, supporters of the academy, including Ann Robinson, said#e72 the Saudis were just providing#e73 a service and#13#0 it was unfair#e153 to penalize#e76 children. We do not further#0#0#e155 the purpose of human rights in the world by violating#e78 the human rights under our own constitution. But#31#Comparison opponents said#e80 the school might be a target for#23#0 terrorist attacks#e83, complained#e84 about its tax exempt status, and#14#0 wondered#e85 why the Saudis are not compelled#e86 to allow#e89 Christians to worship#e90 in their country. Virginia Welch delivered#e91 this message to the county board of supervisors. I urge#e94 you to do#e96 the right thing and#15#0 send#e98 a message to the Saudis that the citizens of Loudon county embrace#e100 religious and#16#0 human freedom. Loudon county officials say#e101 they ll rule#e102 on the application based only on land use issues and#17#0 ignore#e108 all the other objections. What's really behind those objections, some say#e111, is Loudon county's collision#e112 with a new reality in America that the country is changing#e160 religiously as#33#0 surely as#34#0 it is racially and#18#0 ethnically. According#e161 to the Arab American institute, Islam will one#t163>day#t163 be the second largest religion in the country. For#24#0 an indication of the problems that could face Muslims as#35#0 they integrate into American life, one need look no farther than Loudon county, Virginia. For#25#0 The World, I m Nancy Marshalll.
