Times News Service LR QC QL The Bureau of Labor Statistics said#e9 the economy added#e10 358,000 jobs last#t195>month#t195, far above the 235,000 forecast#e12 by economists. It was the third consecutive month that job generation has been exceptionally strong. With growing opportunities for#18#0 work drawing#e15 more people into the labor force, the unemployment rate remained#e17 at 4.7 percent last#t196>month#t196, just a notch above its quarter-century low. The demand#e229 for#19#0 workers also#10#Expansion led#e231 employers to raise#e20 wages again last#t198>month#t198. Average hourly#t1001 earnings of production and#33#0 nonsupervisory employees rose#e23 4 cents, to  $  12.51. The gain left#e24 wages 3.8 percent higher than a#t199>year#t199>earlier#1#0#t199, extending#e26 a trend#e2018 that has given#e27 back to workers some of the earning power they lost#e28 to inflation in the#t200>last#t200>decade#t200. But#30#Comparison economists said#e30 the wage increase#e31 was not enough to raise#e32 any concerns about higher inflation. And#34#Expansion because#2#Contingency the Federal Reserve has made#e34 clear that it expects#e35 the economy to slow#e37 in coming#t201>months#t201 as#50#0 ripple effects from Asia reach#e232 the United States, investors disregarded#e39 the large jobs gains, betting#e40 that neither#4#0 a rise#e41 in interest rates nor#4#0 resurgent inflation#e43 is looming#e44. Stocks rose#e45, pushing#e46 the Dow Jones industrial average up 72.24 points, to 8,189.49, leaving#e47 the index within 70 points of its record high set on Aug.#t202>6#t202. In the bond market, a sensitive barometer of inflation anxiety, prices edged#e52 up, pushing#e53 down the yield on the benchmark 30-year#t500 Treasury bond to 5.92 percent from 5.93 percent.`` Job creation#e55 is sturdy and#35#0 we have effective price stability, ''said#e57 Paul McCulley, an economist at UBS Securities.`` The bottom line is that we ve got a lovely economy. ''With potential inflation counterbalanced#e61 by worries about possible price declines#e246, the Fed and#36#0 its chairman, Alan Greenspan, have suggested#e62 that they intend#e63 to keep#e65 interest rates unchanged until#6#Temporal the economy tilts#e66 clearly in one direction or#53#0 another. The job figures for#20#0 January#t203 extended#e69 a surge#e70 in employment gains#e250 that began#e72 last#t204>fall#t204, just when#15#0 the labor market had showed#e75 signs of cooling. After#7#Temporal accounting#e78 for#21#0 a small downward revision#e395 Friday#t205 to December#t206's figures, the economy has been creating#e81 jobs at a rate of 358,000 a month for#22#0 the#t207>last#t207>four#t207>months X#t207 _ and#37#0 381,000 over the#t208>last#t208>three#t208>months#t208 _ after#8#Temporal averaging#e85 242,000 for#23#0 the#t212>first#t212>nine#t212>months#t212 of 1997#t211. The surge in jobs reflects#e89 a remarkable confluence of positive and#38#0 self-reinforcing economic forces. Inflation has been almost nonexistent, and#39#0 consumer confidence has been extremely strong. After#9#0 a short, sharp drop#e251 when#16#0 Asia's financial problems first became#e93 clear, the stock market has rebounded#e95 and#40#0 corporate profits have remained#e96 healthy. Long-term interest rates, an important indicator of economic stability, have fallen#e98 in the#t213>last#t213>few#t213>months#t213. Lower rates have helped#e99 invigorate#e100 housing and#41#0 other interest-sensitive sectors of the economy by making#e101 loans more affordable, and#42#0 have allowed#e102 companies to continue#e104 investing#e105 heavily in more efficient equipment. The likelihood that the federal budget will soon move#e107 from deficit into surplus has further#0#0 improved#e109 the outlook.X X The less money the government needs to borrow, the more is freed for#24#0 private investment. President Clinton welcomed#e115 the job figures at a news conference#e254 Friday#t2181. His advisers said#e117 the results reflected#e256 not just from balancing#e122 the budget, but#31#0 also#11#Expansion initiatives#e257 like improved access to education and#43#0 training and#44#0 the opening of foreign markets to trade.`` There are enormous economic and#45#0 social benefits from our nation's high-employment economy, ''said Janet Yellen, the chairwoman of the White House's Council of Economic Advisers. Some of the biggest employment gains came#e134 in the construction industry, which added#e137 92,000 jobs in January#t215. The increase reflected#e140 the strength of the housing industry, which has been helped#e258 not just by declining interest rates but#32#0 also#12#0 by unusually warm weather. Service industries also#13#Expansion showed#e145 solid job gains, as#51#0 did manufacturers, two areas expected#e146 to be hardest hit#e148 when#17#0 the effects of the Asian crisis hit#e151 the American economy. The major harm#e259 from Asia is likely to come from the plunge#e155 in the value of many Asian currencies relative to the dollar, a situation that is expected#e160 to lead#e162 to a surge#e163 of inexpensive imports into the United States, hurting#e164 American competitors. And#46#Expansion the weakness of the Asian economies is also#14#Expansion likely to lead#e166 to decreased demand for#25#0 American exports.`` The economy has been running#e168 on the fumes of the strength from before#5#0 the Asia shock, ''McCulley said#e169.`` Those fumes will exhaust#e171 themselves, and#47#0 the manufacturing sector is going to start#e174 getting beat#e176 up in the spring. ''The figures showed#e178 the unemployment rate for#26#0 adult men declined#e179 to 3.8 percent last#t218>month#t218 from 4.1 percent in December#t219, the lowest figure for#27#0 almost two#t1002>decades#t1002. The rate for#28#0 adult women rose#e181 0.4 percent, to 4.4 percent. For#29#0 the first time, the Labor Department broke#e183 out unemployment by education level as#3#0 well#3#0 as#52#0 gender, age and#48#0 race. The analysis showed#e186 unemployment rates dropped#e187 steadily with higher levels of education. Among people with less than a high school education, the rate in January#t222 was 7.2 percent. Among high school graduates, the rate was 3.9 percent, and#49#0 college graduates, 1.9 percent. NYT-02-06-98 2219EST
