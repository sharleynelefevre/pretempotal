ABC19980108.1830.0711 19980108#t0 ABC19980108.1830.0711 NEWS STORY On#0#0 the#0#0 other#0#0 hand#0#0, it's turning#e1 out to be another very bad financial week#t83 for#16#0 Asia. The financial assistance#e3 from the World Bank and#7#0 the International Monetary Fund are not helping#e4. In the#t85>last#t85>twenty#t85>four#t85>hours#t85, the value of the Indonesian stock market has fallen#e7 by twelve percent. The Indonesian currency has lost#e9 twenty six percent of its value. In Singapore, stocks hit#e10 a five#t86>year#t86 low. In the Philippines, a four#t87>year#t87 low. And#8#Expansion in Hong Kong, a three percent drop#e147. More problems in Hong Kong for#17#0 a place, for#18#0 an economy, that many experts thought#e11 was once#5#0 invincible#e376. Here's ABC's Jim Laurie. Not that long ago, before#2#0 the Chinese takeover#e12, the news about real estate here was that the sky was the limit the highest prices in the world. So#24#Contingency when#6#0 Wong Kwan spent#e16 seventy million dollars for#19#0 this house, he thought#e17 it was a great deal#e18. He sold#e19 the property to five buyers and#9#0 said#e20 he'd double#e21 his money. In Hong Kong, is always belongs to the seller's market. Now#t196 with new construction#e26 under way, three of his buyers have backed#e28 out. And#10#Expansion Wong Kwan will be lucky to break#e30 even. All across Hong Kong, the property market has crashed#e32. Pamela Pak owns#e33 eight condominiums here. Pak can't find#e34 buyers. She estimates#e37 her properties, worth#e88 a hundred thirty million dollars in October#t89, are worth#e91 only half that now#t90. They believe#e39 ah it will be always up going#e40 up and#11#0 up ah forever. Nobody believe#e41 this any more. Of all of Asia's economies, Hong Kong is the most robust. But#15#Comparison in the#t98>past#t98>three#t98>months#t98, stocks have plunged#e42, interest rates have soared#e43 and#12#0 the downturn#e44 all across Asia means that people are not spending#e46 here. Hotels are only thirty percent full. You can get#e48 seventy percent discounts#e50 at the shopping malls. Three thousand dollar pearls for#20#0 eight hundred dollars. A two hundred dollar wool jacket for#21#0 fifty dollars. Still#3#Comparison, there are few buyers. And#13#Expansion at the big brokerage houses, after#4#0 ten#t99>years#t99 of boom#e52, they're talking#e53 about layoffs#e54. I think#e55 that the mood is fairly gloomy#e374, and#14#0 I think#e56 it's not going to change#e59 for#22#0 a#t100>couple#t100>of#t100>years#t100. So#25#0 for#23#0 Hong Kong, it's time, as#26#0 investment bankers like to say, to reposition#e64. To either#1#0 hold#e65 on tight or#1#0 get#e66 out, as#27#0 much of Asia goes#e67 into recession#e368. Jim Laurie, ABC News, Hong Kong.
