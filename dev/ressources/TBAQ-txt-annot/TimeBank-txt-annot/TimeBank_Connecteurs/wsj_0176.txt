Xerox Will Lay Off 300 @ At Personal Insurance Unit 11/02/89 WALL STREET JOURNAL (J) XRX Xerox Corp. has told#e1 employees in its Crum amp Forster personal insurance operations that it is laying#e2 off about 300 people, or#13#0 25 % of the staff. A spokeswoman for#3#0 Crum amp Forster said#e3 employees were told#e4 early#t21>this#t21>week#t21 that numerous staff functions for#4#0 the personal insurance lines were going to be centralized#e6 as#10#0 a cost-cutting move. She said#e7 the move#e82 would result#e8 in a after-tax charge of less than  $  4 million to be spread#e10 over the#t23>next#2#0#t23>three#t23>quarters#t23. By#0#0 comparison#0#0, for#5#0 the#t24>first#t24>nine#t24>months#t24, Xerox earned#e11  $  492 million, or#14#0  $  4.55 a share, on revenue of  $  12.97 billion. Earnings at Xerox's financial-services operations actually rose#e12 slightly, but#9#0 that was largely because#1#0 capital gains at Crum amp Forster offset#e13 Hurricane Hugo payments and#6#0 the reserves set up to cover future payments#e3000. Property/casualty insurance has been a tough business in recent#t25>quarters#t25, as#11#0 pricing has been cutthroat and#7#0 natural disasters such as#12#0 Hurricane Hugo and#8#0 the California earthquake have resulted in huge payments.
