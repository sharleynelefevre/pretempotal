His appointment#e51 to that post, which has senior UCP administrative, staff and#5#0 policy responsibilities, followed#e6 a several-year#t44 tenure#e52 as#15#0 Reuters's editor in chief. No successor was named#e7, and#6#0 Mr. Reupke's duties will be split#e8 among three other senior Reuters executives, the company said#e9. In a telephone interview, Mr. Reupke said#e10 his departure#e55 was for#10#0 `` personal reasons, ''which he declined to specify.`` There is no business reason for#11#0 my departure#e57, ''nor#3#0 any disagreement over policy, he added#e14. He also#0#Expansion rejected#e15 reports that his departure#e59 stemmed#e16 from disappointment the general manager's post hadn't also#1#Expansion led#e69 to a board directorship at the London-based news organization. Mr. Reupke was one of three executives on Reuters's eight-person executive committee who didn't also#2#Expansion serve#e21 on the company's board of directors.`` If#16#0 I were choosing#e23 the people of tomorrow, I would have chosen#e24 the people who are now#t46 on#e363 the board, ''he said#e27. A Reuters spokesman said#e28 the departure#e65 reflects#e29 `` no change#e72 in strategy or#18#0 profits. ''Mark Shepperd, an analyst at UBS Phillips amp Drew in London, said#e30, `` I suspect#e31 (the departure#e66) will be fairly irrelevant#e67 for#12#0 the company. I would be very surprised#e32 if#17#0 his departure#e75 signals#e76 any change#e77 in strategy or#19#0 change#e79 in profit expectations. ''On London's Stock Exchange, Reuters shares rose#e35 five pence to 913 pence ( $  14.43). In the U.S. over-the-counter market, American depositary shares for#13#0 Reuters, each representing three shares in the London market, closed#e36 unchanged at  $  43.875.
