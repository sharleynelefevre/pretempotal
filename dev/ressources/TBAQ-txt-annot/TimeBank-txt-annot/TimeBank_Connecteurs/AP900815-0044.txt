''LaserPhotos WX6 ,7, XSAV1, NY5 ,10, TOK1, XAAFB1, AMM1, LaserColor XAAFB1 By CHRISTOPHER BURNS Associated Press Writer Iraq's Saddam Hussein, facing#e5 U.S. and#24#0 Arab troops at the Saudi border, today#t4 sought#e6 peace on another front by promising#e8 to withdraw#e9 from Iranian territory and#25#0 release#e10 soldiers captured#e11 during the Iran-Iraq war#e13. Also#10#Expansion today#t14, King Hussein of Jordan arrived#e15 in Washington seeking#e16 to mediate#e17 the Persian Gulf crisis#e18. President Bush on Tuesday#t22 said#e19 the United States may extend#e23 its naval quarantine to Jordan's Red Sea port of Aqaba to shut#e27 off Iraq's last unhindered trade route. In another mediation effort, the Soviet Union said#e28 today#t380 it had sent#e29 an envoy to the Middle East on a series of stops#e387 to include Baghdad. Soviet officials also#11#Expansion said#e30 Soviet women, children and#26#0 invalids would be allowed#e33 to leave#e34 Iraq. President Bush today#t37 denounced#e35 Saddam's `` ruinous policies of war, ''and#27#0 said#e38 the United States is `` striking#e39 a blow for#14#0 the principle that might does not make right. ''In a speech#e40 delivered#e41 at the Pentagon, Bush seemed#e42 to suggest#e43 that American forces could be in the gulf region for#15#0 some#t47>time#t47.`` No one should doubt#e50 our staying power or#63#0 determination, ''he said#e52. The U.S. military buildup#e53 in Saudi Arabia continued#e54 at fever pace, with Syrian troops now#t56 part of a multinational force camped#e58 out in the desert to guard#e59 the Saudi kingdom from any new thrust#e60 by Iraq. In a letter to President Hashemi Rafsanjani of Iran, read#e61 by a broadcaster over Baghdad radio, Saddam said#e62 he will begin#e63 withdrawing#e64 troops from Iranian territory on Friday#t65 and#28#0 release#e66 Iranian prisoners of war. Iran said#e67 an Iraqi diplomatic delegation was en route to Tehran to deliver#e69 Saddam's message, which it said#e70 it would review#e73 `` with optimism. ''Saddam appeared#e74 to accept#e75 a border demarcation treaty he had rejected#e77 in peace talks#e78 following the August#t79>1988#t79 cease-fire#e80 of the eight-year#t82 war#e81 with Iran. The move seemed#e83 aimed#e84 at heading#e85 off more trouble with Iran, which had condemned#e87 Iraq's invasion#e88 of Kuwait on Aug.#t89>2#t89 but#57#0 also#12#Expansion criticized#e90 the multinational force dispatched#e91 to Saudi Arabia. Saddam said#e92 he sought#e93 to `` turn#e94 the gulf into a lake of peace free of foreign fleets and#29#0 forces that harbor#e97 ill intentions against us. ''In other developments: The Pentagon said#e98 that Defense Secretary Dick Cheney is considering#e99 urging#e100 Bush to order#e101 a national callup#e102 of armed forces reserves for#16#0 active duty because#2#0 of the drain#e104 on units sending#e106 soldiers abroad. Bush can call#e107 up to 200,000 reservists for#17#0 up#t719>to#t719>180#t719>days#t719 without seeking#e110 congressional approval. Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Yuri Gremitskikh said#e112 special ambassador Mikhail Sytenko left#e113 Tuesday#t114 for#18#0 consultations#e116 with the governments of Syria, Jordan, Egypt and#30#0 other Arab countries. Sytenko, a former deputy secretary-general of the United Nations, is also#13#Expansion expected#e117 to visit#e767 Baghdad, Gremitskikh said#e118 at a regular news briefing#e119 today#t120. The outlook darkened#e121 for#19#0 about 3,000 Americans caught#e122 in Iraq and#31#0 Kuwait when#9#0 Saddam sent#e123 his forces into the small, oil-rich sultanate. The Iraqi ambassador to Greece said#e124 in Athens the Americans and#32#0 other stranded foreigners could leave#e126 `` as#1#Temporal soon#1#Temporal as#1#Temporal the threats from the United States and#33#0 its allies are eliminated#e128. ''ABC quoted#e129 an Iraqi Foreign Ministry official in Baghdad as#69#0 saying#e130 Americans in Iraq are `` restrictees ''who will stay#e131 there until#5#Temporal the crisis#e132 ends#e133. The Soviet Foreign Ministry said#e134 Soviet women, children and#34#0 invalids would be permitted#e136 to leave#e137 Iraq. Spokesman Yuri Gremitskikh said#e138 the first group of 230 evacuees was assembling#e139 in Baghdad today#t140, but#58#0 evacuation plans were hampered#e144 by desert heat and#35#0 lack of transportation. Nearly 9,000 Soviets were among the hundreds of thousands of foreigners trapped#e146 in Iraq and#36#0 Kuwait. Iraq has agreed#e147 to allow#e148 all 880 Soviets in Kuwait to leave#e149, but#59#0 only by a 1,200-mile road route through Iraq and#37#0 to the Iraq-Jordan border. The British Foreign Office said#e150 today#t151 conditions in Kuwait appear#e152 to be deteriorating#e153. There have been reports of wholesale looting but#60#0 food and#38#0 gasoline were still#7#0 available, said#e156 a spokesman, who by custom was not identified#e158. Banks remained#e159 closed#e941. The Iraqi ambassador to Venezuela said#e160 on Tuesday#t162 that Iraq would retaliate#e165 against Venezuela and#39#0 other OPEC oil cartel members if#65#0 they boost#e166 oil production to fill#e167 the gap created#e168 by blocked supplies from Iraq and#40#0 Kuwait. With Kuwait now#t170 `` annexed#e171, ''Iraq has control of 20 percent of the world's oil reserves. A steep rise#e173 in world oil prices followed the Kuwait invasion#e175. The U.N. Security Council on Aug.#t176>6#t176 ordered#e177 a global embargo#e178 on trade with Iraq as#70#0 punishment for#20#0 seizing#e180 Kuwait. Bush then#8#0 sent#e181 U.S. troops and#41#0 planes to Saudi Arabia, saying#e182 Iraqi troops massed#e183 nearby in Kuwait threatened#e184 Saudi Arabia and#42#0 its vast oil reserves. Twelve Arab League nations voted#e185 for#21#0 an Arab force to protect#e186 Saudi Arabia, with the vanguard of Syria's contingent arriving#e187 Tuesday#t188, according#e190 to diplomatic sources in Riyadh, the Saudi capital. Egyptian and#43#0 Moroccan troops are already there#e1078. The predominantly Moslem nation of Bangladesh said#e193 today#t194 its troops would join#e196 multinational forces in Saudi Arabia. The size of the contingent was not disclosed#e198. Turkey and#44#0 Saudi Arabia in effect shut#e199 down Iraq's major oil outlets through those countries, but#61#0 according#e200 to Jordanian officials, a smaller line into Jordan remained#e201 operating#e202. Truckloads of goods rolled#e203 into Iraq from Jordan on Tuesday#t204 and#45#0 Iraqi-bound cargo was unloaded#e206 from ships at the Red Sea port ofAqaba despite the U.N.-ordered sanctions#e207. King Hussein was reportedly carrying#e208 a message to Bush from Iraq's Saddam, with whom the king met#e209 Monday#t210. The monarch will meet#e211 Bush on Thursday#t213 in Kennebunkport, Maine. Crown Prince Hassan, King Hussein's brother and#46#0 political adviser, was asked#e214 today#t215 about the message the king was said#e216 to be carrying#e217. In an interview#e218 from Jordan on ABC, he declined#e219 to discuss#e220 details, but#62#0 said#e221: `` I don't think#e223 that his majesty would be traveling#e225 at this#t1192>crucial#t1192>moment#t1192 if#66#0 the Iraqi leadership did not have a rational approach to the future. ''A CBS News report citing#e230 unidentified Jordanian sources said#e231 that Saddam's message called#e232 for#22#0 an international conference to be convened#e234 to discuss#e235 an Iraqi withdrawal#e236 from Kuwait. In exchange, the buildup#e238 of U.S. forces in the region would halt#e240. Bush, however#4#Comparison, says#e241 he sees#e242 no short-term hope for#23#0 a diplomatic solution to the gulf crisis#e244 _ at least until#6#0 economic sanctions force#e245 Saddam to withdraw#e246 his army. Bush held#e247 out the prospect of more aid to Jordan if#67#0 it cooperates#e249 with the trade embargo. On Tuesday#t252, the United States and#47#0 Soviet Union conferred#e253 in Washington on putting#e254 an anti-Iraq naval blockade#e255 under a United Nations umbrella. The United States has provided#e256 most of the naval vessels so#64#0 far to block Iraqi trade, with Britain, West Germany and#48#0 Australia among the other nations lending#e257 support at sea. The embargo#e258 is meant#e259 to cripple#e260 Iraq by cutting#e261 off its exports of oil and#49#0 imports of food and#50#0 military supplies. Iraq imports#e262 about three-quarters of its foodstuffs. U.S. allies and#51#0 other U.N. members have objected#e263 that the Security Council embargo resolution did not specifically#0#0 authorize#e266 such a naval operation#e267. Bush told#e268 a news conference on Tuesday#t269 that the naval barricade now#t271 in force might be extended#e273 to Jordan's Aqaba `` if#68#0 it is a hole through which commerce flows#e274 ''in and#52#0 out of Iraq. In Saudi Arabia, today#t275 is the eighth#t276>day#t276 of `` Desert Shield, ''the operation#e279 designed to confront#e281 an estimated 200,000 Iraqi soldiers now#t282 in Kuwait. Iraq boasts#e283 an army of 1 million members. At least 50,000 U.S. troops are expected#e284 to be committed#e285 to Desert Shield within weeks#t1460, including Marines, Army air assault forces, paratroopers and#53#0 infantry. Iraq said#e290 it invaded#e291 Kuwait because#3#0 of disputes#e292 over oil and#54#0 money. It accused#e293 Kuwait of deliberately slashing#e294 Iraqi oil revenues by overproducing#e295 oil and#55#0 driving#e296 down prices, among other charges. Iraq has#e297 17 million residents, and#56#0 Kuwait about 1.9 million.
