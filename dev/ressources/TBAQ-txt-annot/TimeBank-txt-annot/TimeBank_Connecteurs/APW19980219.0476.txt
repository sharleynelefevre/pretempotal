APW19980219.0476 Gen. Nhek Bunchhay, a loyalist of ousted Cambodian Prime Minister Prince Norodom Ranariddh, said#e9 in an interview#e10 with The Associated Press at his hilltop headquarters that he hopes#e12 to recover#e14 the remains of Christopher Howes within the#t133>next#12#0#t133>two#t133>weeks#t133. Howes had been working#e15 for#22#0 the Britain-based Mines Advisory Group when#8#0 he was abducted#e148 with his Cambodian interpreter Houn Hourth in March#t134>1996#t134. There were many conflicting accounts of his fate#e18. Howes team was clearing#e150 mines 17 kilometers (10 miles) from Angkor Wat, the fabled 11th#t1000>century#t1000 temple that is Cambodia's main tourist attraction, when#9#0 it was attacked#e21. In January#t135>this#t135>year#t135, British police officers who had been searching#e22 for#23#0 Howes concluded#e23 he had probably been killed#e24 soon after#3#Temporal being captured#e26. The Foreign Office said#e27 it had informed#e28 the family of Howes, 37 years old when#10#0 he was kidnapped#e30, that he probably died#e31 within weeks#t137>or#27#0#t137>months#t137 of his capture#e32 on March#t136>26,#t136>1996#t136.`` Obviously, it is deeply discouraging#e33 for#24#0 the family after#4#0 22#t138>months#t138, but#18#0 there is no proof of life. But#19#Comparison there is no evidence in either#1#0 direction _ that there is proof of life or#1#0 death, ''said#e40 a Foreign Office spokesman, speaking#e41 with customary anonymity.`` We will continue#e42 to do#e2446 everything we can to establish#e48 what has happened#e49. ''Thai military officials who monitor Cambodian affairs said#e52 privately Thursday#t2449 that Britain, through its embassies in Thailand and#13#0 Cambodia, has been pushing#e53 hard to resolve#e55 the Howes case as#30#0 the second anniversary#e2447 of his abduction#e56 nears. Nhek Bunchhay, who had been closely involved#e58 in the search#e59 for#25#0 Howes before#2#Temporal having to flee#e64 the Cambodian capital after#5#0 a coup#e160 detat last#t131>year#t131, appeared#e65 confident he would find#e66 Howes remains. He said#e68 he received#e69 information from Khmer Rouge guerrillas on where the body had been buried#e71, and#14#0 recently ordered#e72 10 of his men from a force of 500 near Khmer Rouge headquarters in Anlong Veng to conduct#e162 the search#e76. If#0#Contingency and#0#Contingency when#0#Contingency the remains are found#e78, he said#e79, they would be turned#e80 over to the British Embassy, apparently meaning they would be sent#e83 across the border into Thailand and#15#0 onward to Bangkok. Nhek Bunchhay said#e85 he now#t2452 believed#e2227 Howes had been killed#e87 within a#t140>week#t140 of his capture#e88 by a Khmer Rouge faction loyal to Pol Pot, then#7#0 the guerrilla group's leader. Pol Pot is considered#e89 responsible#e164 for#26#0 the radical policies#e2396 that led#e90 to the deaths#e91 of as#31#0 many as#32#0 1.7 million Cambodians when#11#0 the communist group held#e93 power in the#t142>late#t142>1970s#t142. At the time Howes was captured#e94, the Khmer Rouge were a more or#28#0 less united guerrilla force with more than 10,000 men under arms. But#20#Comparison the group began#e95 to fall#e166 apart in mid-1996#t143 after#6#0 the defection#e96 of one of its top leaders, Ieng Sary. Other commanders, and#16#0 thousands of guerrillas, followed#e98 him. A small hardcore group under Pol Pot continued#e99 to hold#e101 out at their headquarters at Anlong Veng in northern Cambodia near the Thai border. But#21#Comparison in June#t2228>last#t2228>year#t2228, the remaining leadership had a falling#e103 out, and#17#Expansion Pol Pot was arrested#e104. In July#t169>last#t169>year#t169 in Phnom Penh, Cambodia's capital, Second Prime Minister Hun Sen staged#e105 a successful coup#e2448 detat against First Prime Minister Prince Norodom Ranariddh. Ranariddh's loyalists, including Nhek Bunchhay, his top military commander, went#e106 into hiding or#29#0 fled#e109 the capital. Nhek Bunchhay, evading#e110 an intensive manhunt#e111, made#e112 his way to OSmach, the last major outpost held by Ranariddh's forces. His men have held the stronghold _ which is on the border just opposite the Thai province of Surin _ against repeated intense attacks#e116 by Hun Sen's troops. They have been aided#e117 by Khmer Rouge guerrillas from Anlong Veng, who have formed#e118 an alliance with Ranariddh's resistance forces to oppose Hun Sen.
