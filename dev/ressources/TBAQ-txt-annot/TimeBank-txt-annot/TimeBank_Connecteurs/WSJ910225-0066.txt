Breakthrough: U.S. Hails Invasion Of Kuwait and#61#0 Iraq As#113#0 ` Dramatic Success "",-- Troops Meet Little Resistance But#53#0 Allied Forces Face Political, Military Risks-- Long Columns of Iraqi POWs-- By Gerald F. Seib Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal 02/25/91 WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A1 MDEST EUROP FREST EXECUTIVE (EXE) DEFENSE DEPARTMENT (DEF) STATE DEPARTMENT (STD) WASHINGTON-- With the ground battle#e433 to liberate#e435 Kuwait proceeding#e436 with surprising speed and#62#0 success, Bush administration officials are optimistic the Persian Gulf war#e438 can begin#e439 winding#e441 down in a matter of days. The enormous ground offensive#e524 by U.S. Marines and#63#0 Army troops, RRC at least during its first 24 hours, met#e442 only sporadic Iraqi resistance#e443 as#114#0 it quickly penetrated#e444 deep into Kuwait and#64#0 parts of Iraq, military officials said#e446. According to press pool reports#e447, U.S. Marines are already on#e534 the outskirts of Kuwait City.`` So#108#0 far, the offensive#e449 is progressing with dramatic success, ''said#e4 a buoyant Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf, commander of U.S. forces. Similarly#4#Expansion, while#21#Comparison cautioning about the uncertainty of early battle reports, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said#e8 late#t451>yesterday#t451 that `` the operation#e9 has been very successful. ''Amid reports that thousands of Iraqi soldiers had surrendered#e11, administration aides were also#37#Expansion upbeat in private, with one even talking#e12 of victory within a week. But#54#Comparison even continued military success carries#e16 political and#65#0 diplomatic risks for#41#0 President Bush and#66#0 the U.S. The allied rejection#e18 of the last-minute Soviet-led diplomatic effort#e19 to avoid#e21 the ground war#e22 enabled#e23 Mr. Bush to seize#e25 the initiative from an Iraq seemingly bent on dictating#e452 peace terms. But#55#Comparison it has offended#e28 some, especially in Arab countries, who now believe#e29 that Mr. Bush's real objectives are the demise#e453 of Saddam Hussein and#67#0 the destruction#e30 of the Iraqi military, not just the liberation#e31 of Kuwait.`` Why have a war#e32? ''asked#e33 Abdul Latif Shekar, a customs officer in Egypt, a country participating#e34 in the attack#e35 on Iraqi troops.`` I think#e37 the Gorbachev plan was a good one. Iraq was ready to withdraw#e39. ''Now, he says#e40, `` it looks#e41 like the West just wants#e42 to destroy#e44 Iraq. ''Despite the early indications of success, the allied forces could still#22#0 suffer#e47 greater casualties and#68#0 become#e526 bogged#e456 down militarily, especially when#32#0 they encounter#e52 the tough Republican Guard, which is entrenched#e53 along the Iraq-Kuwait border.UCP If#124#0 so#109#0, and#69#Expansion if#125#0 it appears#e55 that the American goal actually is to destroy#e58 the Iraqi regime even at the cost of badly hurting Iraqi society, `` the lingering cost of that could be high, ''worries#e458 former national security adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski. But#56#Comparison, he notes#e62, `` If#126#0 everything crumbles#e459 totally, that won't be such a problem. ''American officials staunchly disavow#e64 any interest in driving#e66 through Iraq toward Baghdad, either#12#0 in pursuit#e67 of Saddam Hussein himself or#12#0 to set#e69 up some American-controlled government inside Iraq. The Americans say#e70 their battle plans call#e71 for#42#0 operating#e72 against forces inside Iraq as#115#0 far north as#116#0 the city of Basra, about 30 miles north of Kuwait, but#57#0 say there isn't any plan to drive#e76 beyond that. Indeed#18#Expansion, French President Francois Mitterrand said#e77 yesterday#t463 that some allied forces are crossing#e78 Iraqi territory as#117#0 part of a `` pincer ''movement to trap#e466 the soldiers occupying Kuwait, but#58#0 insisted#e81, `` The purpose isn't to invade#e82 Iraqi territory, that's not the aim, that isn't the mandate. ''Nevertheless#0#Comparison, American officials over the#t472>weekend#t472 became#e84 more open#e473 in declaring#e86 that by destroying#e87 Saddam Hussein's military machine they hope#e88 to destroy#e90 his regime-- a goal likely to be supported#e93 by most Americans. In a pre-attack message, Lt. Gen. Walter Boomer, the top Marine in the Persian Gulf, told#e95 U.S. Marines that their goal is to ''restore#e98 -LCB- Kuwait -RCB- to its citizens. ''He went#e99 on to add#e102 that `` in so#110#Contingency doing#e104 you not only return#e105 a nation to its people, but#59#0 you will destroy#e106 the war machine of a ruthless dictator. ''NAC Secretary of State James Baker said#e107 on ABC-TV's `` This Week With David Brinkley ''that the series of United Nations resolutions condemning#e478 Iraq's invasion#e110 of Kuwait `` imply#e111 that the restoration#e112 of peace and#70#0 stability in the Gulf would be a heck of a lot easier if#127#0 he and#71#0 that leadership were not in power in Iraq. ''Of course, it is still#23#0 far too early to assume#e120 that the military situation#e482 on the ground will stay#e122 as#118#0 smooth for#43#0 allied forces as#119#0 it appears#e124 to have been so#111#0 far. Iraq still#24#0 has#e127 the potential to cause#e129 significant problems by using#e130 forces and#72#0 weapons that don't yet#102#0 seem#e132 fully engaged#e133. For#44#0 one thing, Iraq still#25#0 apparently hasn't unleashed#e135 its stockpile of chemical weapons. Gen. Schwarzkopf said#e138 that some early reports that chemical weapons were used#e141 against allied troops turned#e142 out to be `` bogus. ''Iraq is believed#e144 to have#e146 the ability to deliver#e148 chemical weapons in artillery shells or#105#0, perhaps, atop Soviet-made Frog7 missiles. Perhaps more important, it appears#e150 that allied troops haven't yet#103#0 fully engaged#e151 Iraq's vaunted Republican Guard, which has been sitting#e487 just north of the Iraq-Kuwait border and#73#0 is considered#e154 the most potent element in the Iraqi defense. It remains#e157 to be seen#e159 WH how much damage#e160 the allied air campaign#e161 was able to inflict#e163 on the Guard, and#74#0 whether President Hussein will commit#e164 his most valued troops to a fight-to-the-death finish. Certainly Saddam Hussein continues#e166 to implore#e168 his country to fight#e169 on.`` Fight#e170 them, ''he urged#e171 Iraqis in a radio address#e173.`` All Iraqis, fight#e174 them with all the power you have#e175, and#75#0 all struggle#e176 for#45#0 everything. ''American war planners have long assumed#e180 that the early stage of the ground attack#e181, in which American forces would use#e182 their speed to sweep#e185 around Iraqi defenses and#76#0 their strength to punch#e188 through the relatively weak Iraqi front line, would be the easiest part. Despite these early successes, the mere fact that a ground campaign#e194 has begun#e195 almost guarantees#e196 that the Bush administration will face#e527 fresh problems growing#e197 out of the military situation#e491. There are likely to be additional American prisoners of war taken, and#77#0 there are signs that President Hussein is taking#e202 Kuwaiti hostages. U.S. and#78#0 Kuwaiti officials say#e203 there are reports that large numbers of civilians from Kuwait City are being rounded#e492 up and#79#0 held#e207 by Iraqi troops, apparently either#13#0 for#46#0 use#e208 as#120#0 human shields or#13#0 for#47#0 use#e209 later#26#0 in bargaining#e210 once#38#Temporal the war#e211 is over. President Bush's political argument for#48#0 going#e213 to a ground war#e214 has been strengthened#e215 by the growing stream of reports of wanton Iraqi destruction#e217 inside Kuwait. U.S. officials say#e218 that hundreds of Kuwaiti oil wells now may have been set#e219 afire. And#80#Expansion Robert Gates, Mr. Bush's deputy national security adviser, asserted#e221 in an interview#e222 on the Cable News Network that Iraqi troops have set#e224 fire to `` large sections ''of Kuwait City. Mr. Bush and#81#0 his aides were leaning#e227 toward a military conclusion#e528 of the crisis#e228 even before#16#0 the latest reports of Iraqi atrocities#e231 in Kuwait came#e232 to light. The president and#82#0 his top aides tentatively decided#e235 on Feb.#t494>11#t494 that a ground war#e236 would be necessary#e538. The decision#e238 was made#e239 after#28#0 Defense Secretary Dick Cheney and#83#0 Gen. Colin Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, returned#e240 from a visit#e241 with military commanders in Saudi Arabia, administration officials say#e243. Then#39#Temporal, a#t496>week#t496>or#106#0#t496>so#112#0#t496>ago#t496, Gen. Schwarzkopf secretly picked#e244 Saturday#t498>night#t498 as#121#0 the optimal time to start#e247 the offensive#e248. The date was unaffected#e500 by the last-ditch Soviet peace initiative#e249. The real problem with the Soviet proposals, U.S. officials now say#e251, was that they all would have required#e252 lifting#e254 economic sanctions#e255 against Iraq. The Bush administration considers#e256 the sanctions#e257 essential to keeping#e258 Saddam Hussein under control should he survive#e259 the war#e260. Mr. Bush forestalled#e261 further#8#0 diplomatic maneuvering#e504 by issuing#e262 an ultimatum on behalf of the allies demanding#e266 that Iraq withdraw#e267 within a#t505>week#t505, starting#e268 at noon#t507>Saturday#t507. Administration aides said#e269 that the idea of the ultimatum was Gen. Powell s. He argued#e271 setting#e272 an explicit deadline for#49#0 Saddam Hussein to break#e274 would, when#33#0 it was broken#e276, give#e277 the U.S. military a clear green light to proceed#e279. In setting#e280 out his final challenge to Saddam Hussein, Mr. Bush continued#e282 the intensive personal diplomacy#e283 he began#e284 after#29#0 the invasion#e285 last#t508>August#t508. After#30#Temporal cabling#e287 world leaders about his intention to give#e289 Saddam Hussein a final deadline to exit#e290 Kuwait, he offered#e291 him a#t518>week#t518 to withdraw#e293 UCP fully, instead#11#0 of the#t519>four#t519>days#t519 he originally considered#e294, because#10#0 of objections#e295 from some European partners that four days seemed#e296 punitive and#84#0 unrealistic. And#85#Expansion when#34#0 he and#86#0 President Gorbachev spoke#e298 about the decision#e299 in a talk#e511 lasting nearly#t520>an#t520>hour#t520, the President took#e300 pains to listen#e303 to what his counterpart had to say#e306, although#6#Comparison he already had decided#e307 that the Soviet alternative to the allied deadline was unacceptable#e539. Finally#9#0, when#35#0 Iraq failed#e309 to respond#e311 to the U.S. ultimatum, Mr. Bush let#e312 the ground offensive#e513 begin#e313 as#122#0 previously#1#0 planned#e314 Saturday#t514>night#t514. The attack#e315 was lightning quick, as#123#0 allied forces punched#e317 through tall sand berms on the border and#87#0 pushed#e318 forward into Iraq and#88#0 Kuwait. U.S. Marines were said#e319 to have breached#e321 troublesome mine fields along the Iraqi lines but#60#0 Pentagon officials said#e323 no amphibious assault#e324 on Kuwait's beaches had begun#e325. Long columns of Iraqi prisoners of war could be seen#e327 trudging#e329 through the desert toward the allied rear. U.S. commanders said#e331 5,500 Iraqi prisoners were taken#e332 in the#t21>first#t21>hours#t21 of the ground war#e334, though#15#0 some military officials later#27#Temporal said#e335 the total may have climbed#e336 above 8,000. The U.S. hopes#e338 its troops will drive#e339 Iraqi forces out of Kuwait quickly, leaving#e340 much of Iraq's offensive military equipment destroyed#e341 or#107#0 abandoned#e342 in Kuwait. It expects#e343 that tens of thousands of Iraqi soldiers will surrender#e344 to the U.S. and#89#0 its allies over the#t517>next#36#0#t517>few#t517>days#t517. If#128#0 the allies succeed#e345, Saddam Hussein will have plunged#e346 his country first into a fruitless eight-year#t521 war#e347 against Iran and#90#0 then#128#0 into a humiliating war#e349 against the U.S. and#91#0 the allies to defend#e352 his conquest#e353 of Kuwait, leaving#e354 much of his country's military establishment and#92#0 modern infrastructure in ruins. Meanwhile#3#Expansion, the U.S. hopes#e356, economic sanctions#e357 and#93#0 an international arms embargo#e518 will remain#e358 in effect until#20#Temporal Iraq pays#e359 war reparations to Kuwait to cover#e362 war damages. That would undermine#e363 any chances of rebuilding#e365 either#14#0 Iraq or#14#0 its armed forces in#5#0 short#5#0 order as#2#0 long#2#0 as#2#0 Saddam Hussein remains#e368 in power. The American hope is that someone from within Iraq, RRC perhaps from the army's professional ranks, will step forward and#94#0 push Saddam Hussein aside so#7#0 that#7#0 the country can begin recovering from the disaster. Outside analysts think#e369 Saddam Hussein's position is indeed#19#0 precarious.`` I think frankly Saddam is finished#e378, no matter what happens#e380, ''says#e381 Christine Helms, a Middle East scholar who has written#e382 extensively about Iraq.`` These guys simply don't retire#e383 to condos over the Euphrates. ''Despite the lack of any obvious successors, the Iraqi leader's internal power base appeared#e385 to be narrowing#e387 even before#17#0 the war#e388 began#e390. Some analysts say#e391 he appeared#e392 to be relying#e394 on a smaller and#95#0 smaller circle of close advisers and#96#0 relatives. If#129#0 that's true, the narrowing of his support would make#e398 it easier for#50#0 someone to push#e401 him aside from within. Yet#104#Comparison, paradoxically, the perception that the U.S. wants#e402 to destroy#e404 Iraq may increase#e405 Saddam Hussein's support within the Iraqi military. And#97#Expansion the U.S. now will face#e523 sharper questions in the Arab world since#31#0 it didn't back#e409 the peace proposals worked out in Moscow.`` We looked#e413 to the United States, we expected#e414 you to have#e416 the moral edge, ''says#e417 Nasser Tahboub, a Jerusalem-born Jordanian who has#e418 an American wife and#98#0 a doctorate in political science from Duke University.`` Now we see#e420 that edge eroded#e421. For#51#0 me, it is a great tragedy#e422. For#52#0 the first time in history, the U.S. has gone#e424 to war#e425 with an Arab and#99#0 Muslim nation, and#100#0 we know#e426 a peaceful solution was in reach.
