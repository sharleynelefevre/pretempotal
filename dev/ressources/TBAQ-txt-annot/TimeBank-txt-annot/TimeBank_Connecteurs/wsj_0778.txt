wsj_0778 Law: @ U.S. Threats to Seize Fees X @ Scare Lawyers From Cases @-- X @ By Laurie P. Cohen @ Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal 10/27/89 WALL STREET JOURNAL (J) CRZYQ LAW AND#17#0 LEGAL AFFAIRS (LAW) BANKRUPTCIES (BCY) JUSTICE DEPARTMENT (JUS) SECURITIES AND#18#0 EXCHANGE COMMISSION (SEC) And#19#Expansion defense lawyers are warning#e8 that they won't stick#e9 around if#35#0 they don't get paid#e14. The issue has come to a boil in Newark, N.J., where federal prosecutors have warned#e16 lawyers for#33#0 Eddie Antar that if#36#0 the NX NX founder and#20#0 NX former chairman of Crazy Eddie Inc. is indicted#e18, the government may move#e19 to seize#e22 the money that Mr. Antar is using#e24 to pay#e26 legal fees. The warning#e27 by the U.S. attorney's office follows two decisions#e29 by the U.S. Supreme Court last#t233>June#t233. In those cases, the high court ruled#e31 that federal law gives#e33 prosecutors broad authority to seize#e35 assets of people accused of racketeering and#21#0 drug-related crimes, including fees paid to lawyers before#7#0 an indictment. If#37#0 the government succeeds#e42 in seizing#e44 Mr. Antar's assets, he could be left#e45 without top-flight legal representation, because#3#Contingency his attorneys are likely to quit#e48, according#e206 to individuals familiar with the case. A seizure#e50 also#14#Expansion would make#e51 the case the largest-- and#22#0 one of the first-- in which lawyers fees have been confiscated in a prosecution unrelated to drugs.`` The people who suffer in the short run are defendants, but#16#0 the people who suffer in the long run are all of the people, because#4#Contingency there won't be a vigorous private bar to defend the Bill of Rights, ''says#e66 Gerald Lefcourt, a criminal defense attorney who says#e67 he has turned#e68 down a number of cases to avoid#e71 possible fee seizures#e72. Mr. Antar is being investigated#e73 by a federal grand jury in Newark, where prosecutors have told#e74 him that they may soon#t234 seek#e75 an indictment on racketeering and#23#0 securities fraud charges. Under the Racketeer Influenced and#24#0 Corrupt Organizations law, or#40#0 RICO, the government has#e84 the authority to seek#e86 to freeze#e88 or#41#0 seize#e89 a defendant's assets before#8#0 trial#e90. According#e208 to individuals familiar with Mr. Antar's case, prosecutors issued#e93 their warning this#t235>week#t235 after#11#0 one of Mr. Antar's attorneys asked#e95 whether legal fees might be subject#e210 to seizure#e98. In a letter, prosecutors told#e100 Mr. Antar's lawyers that because#5#Contingency of the recent#t236 Supreme Court rulings#e214, they could expect#e101 that any fees collected from Mr. Antar may be seized#e104. Prosecutors have told#e106 Mr. Antar's attorneys that they believe#e107 Mr. Antar's allegedly ill-gotten gains are so#42#0 great that any money he has used to pay attorneys derives#e112 from illegal activities#e113. Therefore#1#Contingency, they said#e114, the money can be taken#e116 from the lawyers even after#12#0 they are paid#e118. Justin Feldman and#25#0 Jack Arseneault, attorneys for#34#0 Mr. Antar, both declined#e119 to comment#e121 on the matter. In Newark, U.S. Attorney Samuel A. Alito said#e123, `` I don't think#e124 there's any legal reason to limit#e216 forfeiture of attorney's fees to drug cases. ''Mr. Alito said#e128 his office `` just responded#e129 to an attorney's question about whether we would go#e131 after#13#0 attorney's fees, and#26#0 that is different from actually doing it, although#2#Comparison we reserve#e218 that right. ''Mr. Antar was charged#e137 last#t237>month#t237 in a civil suit filed#e140 in federal court in Newark by the Securities and#27#0 Exchange Commission. In that suit, the SEC accused#e143 Mr. Antar of engaging#e144 in a `` massive financial fraud#e145 ''to overstate#e147 the earnings of Crazy Eddie, Edison, N.J., over a#t238>three-year#t238>period#t238. Through his lawyers, Mr. Antar has denied#e148 allegations#e149 in the SEC suit and#28#0 in civil suits previously#0#0 filed#e154 by shareholders against Mr. Antar and#29#0 others. The SEC has alleged#e155 that Mr. Antar aimed#e156 to pump#e158 up the company's stock price through false financial statements in order to sell#e164 his stake and#30#0 reap#e166 huge profits. Mr. Antar, the SEC said#e167, made#e168 more than  $  60 million from the sale#e169 of his shares between 1985#t240 and#31#0 1987#t241. The Justice Department has emphasized#e171 that the government's fee-forfeiture power is to be used#e173 sparingly. According#e226 to department policy, prosecutors must make a strong showing#e176 that lawyers fees came#e177 from assets tainted by illegal profits before#9#Temporal any attempts#e179 at seizure#e181 are made#e183. Still#10#Comparison, criminal defense lawyers worry#e184 that defendants are being deprived#e185 of their Sixth Amendment right to counsel and#32#0 a fair trial#e188 if#38#0 the government can seize#e190 lawyers fees. They also#15#Expansion worry#e228 that if#39#0 the government applies#e193 asset-forfeiture laws broadly, the best defense lawyers will be unwilling#e230 to take#e196 criminal cases unless#6#0 they are assured#e198 of being paid#e199.
