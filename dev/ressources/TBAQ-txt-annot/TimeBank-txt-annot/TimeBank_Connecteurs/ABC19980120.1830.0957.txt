ABC19980120.1830.0957 19980120#t0 ABC19980120.1830.0957 NEWS STORY For#14#0 his part, Fidel Castro is the ultimate political survivor. People have predicted#e1 his demise#e86 so#25#0 many times, and#6#0 the US has tried#e2 to hasten#e4 it on several occasions.UCP Time and#7#0 again, he endures#e87. He has outlasted#e7 and#8#0 sometimes outsmarted#e8 eight American presidents. Fidel Castro invited#e9 John Paul to come#e11 for#15#0 a reason. This is clearly an opportunity for#16#0 Cuba to look good internationally. The entire world will see#e15 images of the Pope in Cuba. They ll see#e16 images of the Pope with Fidel Castro. It will give#e18 the rest of the world the view that Cuba is like any other nation, something the US has, of course, tried#e22 to persuade#e24 the world that it is not. For#17#0 nearly#t94>forty#t94>years#t94, the United States has said#e26 categorically it would not tolerate#e99 totalitarian rule in its own backyard. It is the US economic and#9#0 political embargo#e240 which has kept#e30 Cuba in a box. The main positive for#18#0 Castro to invite#e32 the Pope is international, to be able#e100 to say#e35 to the rest of the world, this government is not as#21#0 closed, as#22#0 intolerant, uh as#23#0 totalitarian as#24#0 some make#e38 it out to be. One of the scenarios widely advanced#e103 before#1#Temporal the visit#e42 is that through the Pope, Cuba, still#2#0 led#e44 by Castro, can begin#e45 a more productive relationship with the world. That will, in#0#Temporal turn#0#Temporal, bring#e48 pressure on Washington to change#e50. Those observers looking#e51 for#19#0 a battle#e52 between uncompromising representatives and#10#0 very different ideologies will, in all likelihood, be disappointed#e53. Castro has said that you can be a Communist and#11#0 still#3#0 be a Christian. He says#e56 he and#12#0 the Pope both want#e57 to end#e59 the exploitation#e60 of man by man. The question is who will Cubans believe#e378? The main negative is the risk that the Pope's visit#e63 will persuade#e64 a great many more Cubans to break#e66 loose of the Cuban government. If#27#0 so#26#0, then#27#0 the Pope's visit#e67 would really open#e112 up a new chapter in the government's relations with its own society. For#20#0 the Cuban government, that is the risk. At the end of the broadcast this#t1000>evening#t1000, one more trip around Havana to see what it's been like since#4#0 the last time. And#13#Expansion in just a moment Diane Sawyer will have some other news.
