Lehner @ Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal 10/30/89 WALL STREET JOURNAL (J) J.SNE TENDER OFFERS, MERGERS, ACQUISITIONS (TNM) HOME ELECTRONICS, FURNISHINGS, APPLIANCES (HMF) TOKYO Polly Peck International Inc.'s agreement#e1 to acquire#e3 51 % of Sansui Electric Co. proves that foreign companies can acquire Japanese companies-- if#46#0 the alternative for#10#0 the Japanese company is extinction. Polly Peck, a fast-growing British conglomerate, will pay#e8 15.6 billion yen ( $  110 million) for#11#0 39 million new shares of Sansui, a well-known maker of high-fidelity audio equipment that failed#e9 to adjust#e11 to changing market conditions. Japanese government officials, eager to rebut#e14 foreign criticism#e195 of Japanese investments#e16 overseas, hailed#e17 the transaction#e18 as#50#0 proof foreigners can make similar investments in Japan. Polly Peck's chairman, Asil Nadir, echoed#e22 the official Japanese view of the accord#e198, which was announced#e23 Friday#t200.`` The myths that Japan is not open to concerns from outside has, I think, been demolished#e27 at a stroke, ''Mr. Nadir said#e30. But#38#Comparison analysts say#e31 Sansui is a special case. It expects#e33 to post#e35 a loss#e36 of 6.4 billion yen for#12#0 the#t204>year#t204 ending tomorrow#t205 and#23#0 its liabilities currently#t207 exceed#e39 its assets by about 13.8 billion yen.`` If#47#0 you find#e246 sound, healthy companies in Japan, they are not for#13#0 sale, ''said#e43 George Watanabe, a management-consultant at Tokyo-based Asia Advisory Services Inc. Statistics on acquisitions by foreigners vary in detail, because#0#Contingency unlike Sansui, which is listed on the Tokyo and#24#0 Osaka stock exchanges, most of the Japanese companies acquired#e3000 by foreigners are privately held. But#39#Comparison by all accounts foreign companies have bought only a relative handful of Japanese companies this#t211>year#t211, while#2#0 Japanese companies have acquired hundreds of foreign companies. Nor#22#Expansion do analysts expect#e56 the Sansui deal to touch#e58 off a fresh wave of foreign purchases. If#48#0 the strong yen and#25#0 the high stock prices of Japanese companies weren't deterrents enough, webs of cross-shareholdings between friendly Japanese companies and#26#0 fiercely independent Japanese corporate attitudes repel#e62 most would-be acquirers. Usually when#7#0 a Japanese company is ready to sell, it has few alternatives remaining, and#27#0 the grim demeanors of Sansui's directors at a joint news conference here left little doubt that this was not the company's finest hour. Sansui was once#8#0 one of Japan's premier makers of expensive, high-quality stereo gear for#14#0 audiophiles. But#40#Comparison in recent#t216>years#t216, the market has moved#e71 toward less expensive `` mini-component ''sets, miniaturized NX NX amplifiers and#28#0 NX receivers and#29#0 NX software players that could be stacked on top of each other. Some of Sansui's fellow audio-specialty companies, such as#51#0 Aiwa Co. and#30#0 Pioneer Electric Corp., responded#e75 to the challenge#e76 by quickly bringing#e77 out mini-component products of their own, by moving#e78 heavily into the booming compact disk businesses or#44#0 by diversifying#e81 into other consumer-electronics fields, including laser disks or#45#0 portable cassette players. Sansui was late into the mini-component business and#31#0 failed#e85 to branch#e87 into other new businesses. As#52#0 the yen soared#e90 in recent#t217>years#t217, Sansui's deepening financial problems became#e92 a vicious circle. While#3#0 competitors moved#e93 production offshore in response to the sagging competitiveness of Japanese factories, Sansui lacked#e95 the money to build#e98 new plants in Southeast Asia.`` Our company has not been able#e224 to cope#e225 very effectively with ''changes#e102 in the marketplace, said#e105 Ryosuke Ito, Sansui's president. But#41#Comparison even a Japanese company that looks like a dog may turn out to be a good investment for#15#0 a foreign concern, some management consultants maintain. Yoshihisa Murasawa, a management consultant for#16#0 Booz-Allen amp Hamilton (Japan) Inc., said#e113 his firm will likely be recommending#e115 acquisitions#e116 of Japanese companies more often to foreign clients in the#t228>future#t228.`` Attitudes -LCB- toward being acquired -RCB- are still#5#0 negative, but#42#0 they're becoming#e119 more positive, ''Mr. Murasawa said#e120.`` In some industries, like pharmaceuticals, acquisitions make#e249 sense. ''Whether Polly Peck's acquisition#e125 makes#e248 sense remains#e233 to be seen#e130, but#43#0 at the news conference, Mr. Nadir brimmed#e131 with self-confidence that he can turn#e132 Sansui around. Sansui, he said#e3001, is a perfect fit for#17#0 Polly Peck's electronics operations, which make televisions, videocassette recorders, microwaves and#32#0 other products on an `` original equipment maker ''basis for#18#0 sale under other companies brand names. He said Polly Peck will greatly expand#e141 Sansui's product line, using Sansui's engineers to design#e145 the new products, and#33#0 will move#e146 Sansui's production of most products other than sophisticated audio gear offshore into Polly Peck's own factories.`` Whatever capital it (Sansui) needs so#49#0 it can compete#e149 and#34#0 become#e151 a totally global entity capable of competing with the best in the world, that capital will be injected#e153, ''Mr. Nadir said#e154. And#35#Expansion while#4#0 Polly Peck isn't jettisoning#e156 the existent top-management structure of Sansui, it is bringing#e158 in a former Toshiba Corp. executive as#53#0 executive NX NX vice president and#36#0 NX chief operating officer. Such risk taking is an everyday matter for#19#0 the brash Mr. Nadir, who is 25 % owner of Polly Peck as#1#0 well#1#0 as#54#0 its chairman. He took#e162 Polly Peck, once#9#0 a small fabric wholesaler, and#37#0 used#e163 it at as#55#0 a base to build#e165 a conglomerate that has been doubling#e166 its profits annually since#6#0 1980#t235. In September#t239, it announced#e167 plans#e240 to acquire#e169 the tropical-fruit business of RJR Nabisco Inc.'s Del Monte foods unit for#20#0 557 million ( $  878 million). Last#t241>month#t241, Polly Peck posted#e171 a 38 % jump#e172 in pretax profit for#21#0 the first half to 54.8 million from 39.8 million on a 63 % rise#e174 in sales. Joann S.
