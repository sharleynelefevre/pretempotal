James Fallon, a NAC New Providence, N.J., marketing consultant to the chemicals industry, says#e65 Du Pont still#11#0 holds#e66 an edge in making the pigment because#8#Contingency the company was `` first in with the technology ''to lower costs. He said#e70 Du Pont holds#e71 about 23 % of the world-wide market, the largest single share, at a time when#14#0 growing uses for#38#0 the pigment have kept it in tight supply, although#1#Comparison others are now adding low-cost production capacity.
