Stertz @ Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal 11/02/89 WALL STREET JOURNAL (J) UPJ DRUG MANUFACTURERS (DRG) KALAMAZOO, Mich. Upjohn officials said#e8 they couldn't estimate#e9 the size of the charge#e81 until#6#Temporal they determine#e12 which employees, and#9#0 how many, will participate#e14 in the retirement plan. But#11#Comparison the pharmaceutical company said#e16 it `` anticipates#e17 the long-term savings resulting from the plan's implementation will more than offset#e91 short-term costs. ''The program, available to Upjohn employees 55 years old or#13#0 older, could increase#e24 an individual's retirement benefits 10 % to 20 %. In#1#Expansion addition#1#Expansion, Upjohn is offering#e29 a one-time retirement bonus equal to six months of base pay. Chairman Theodore Cooper called#e31 the program part of the company's two-year#t190 strategy#e189 to implement#e33 budget constraints and#10#0 `` an effective headcount-control program. ''But#12#Comparison some analysts questioned#e34 how much of an impact the retirement package will have#e36, because#3#Contingency few jobs will end#e38 up being eliminated#e86.`` It's a cosmetic move#e39, ''said#e40 Jonathan S. Gelles of Wertheim Schroder amp Co. According to Upjohn's estimates, only 50 % to 60 % of the 1,100 eligible employees will take#e42 advantage of the plan. Upjohn further#2#0 estimated#e43 that about 50 % of the employees who leave#e44 for#7#0 early retirement may be replaced#e46. As#0#Contingency a#0#Contingency result#0#Contingency, Upjohn will likely trim#e50 only about 275 to 350 of its more than 21,000 jobs world-wide. In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday#t92, Upjohn shares rose#e53 87.5 cents to  $  38.875 apiece. An Upjohn spokesman said#e54 he had ''heard#e399 nothing ''to suggest#e57 the early retirement package was spurred#e58 by shareholder pressure or#14#0 a potential bidder for#8#0 the company, which occasionally has been the target of takeover speculation. The company earlier#4#0#t372>this#t372>year#t372 adopted#e61 a shareholder-rights plan to ward#e63 off unwanted suitors. The spokesman said#e64 it is the first early retirement plan offered#e65 under its two-year#t500 cost-control strategy. Earlier#5#0#t404 staff-reduction moves#e66 have trimmed#e67 about 300 jobs, the spokesman said#e69.
