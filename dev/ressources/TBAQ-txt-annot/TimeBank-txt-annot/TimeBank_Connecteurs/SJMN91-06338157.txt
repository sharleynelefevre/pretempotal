Sununu was told#e85 Wednesday#t73 by Bush's son, George, that he had alienated#e75 members of the Cabinet, the White House staff and#6#0 the Republican political community, creating#e76 a situation that puts his effectiveness in significant doubt, the sources said#e77. The message to the chief of staff was meant to be taken as#13#0 a suggestion that Sununu offer to resign, one highly placed source said#e8. Instead#1#Expansion, Sununu sought#e9 to prove#e11 to the president that his supporters outnumber#e12 his critics and#7#Expansion that he should remain#e13 in his post.

The source said#e37 the younger Bush `` sketched#e38 out for#12#0 Sununu ''problems the president is encountering#e39 because#2#0 of the chief of staff's tenure.`` He was told#e40.. the handwriting was on#e317 the wall, ''the source said#e43 Monday#t87. That, the source said#e44, was when#4#0 Sununu started#e46 calling#e47 congressional Republicans and#11#0 asking#e48 them to tell#e50 Bush that the conservative wing of the party, in#0#Expansion particular#0#Expansion, would object#e53 if#15#0 he were fired#e316. Officials said#e55 the president himself met#e56 with Sununu Sunday#t88. A source said#e57 the outcome of that session#e59 was unclear.
