VOA19980305.1800.2603 A major focus of International Women's Day is the plight of Afghan women. Special events#e67 are being organized#e3 by the European Commission and#1#0 individual nations in Europe, North America, and#2#0 other parts of the world. Lisa Schlein reports from Geneva. Afghanistan has been at war for#15#0 twenty#t70>years#t70, leaving#e6 a large part of the country's male population dead or#22#0 in exile. The United Nations says#e7 women and#3#0 children make#e8 up about seventy-five percent of the Afghan population. An Afghan refugee in Switzerland, Homira Atimadi, is a senior official of a group called the International Working Group on Afghan Women. The group has branches in Pakistan, Iran, Europe, Australia, and#4#0 North America. Ms. Atimadi says#e10 Afghan women have been victims of severe violations#e75 of human rights for#16#0 the#t77>past#t77>twenty#t77>years#t77 and#5#0 she says#e12 she sees#e13 no end#e78 to the misery. She says#e15 security under the fundamentalist Taleban government is better#e80, but#12#0 everything else#0#0 is worse#e81. Women do not become#e18 victims of armed attack#e20, but#13#0 they do not have the right to work#e21. And#6#Expansion today#t87, the right to work is equal#e90 to r- the right to survival. Ms. Atimadi says#e23 the war#e24 has created#e25 a nation of widows. Women have become#e26 the sole support#e27 of their families. Yet#20#Comparison, the Taliban have forbidden#e28 them to work#e29. She says#e30 this puts#e31 the very existence of women's families at risk. She says#e34 the plight of women in urban areas is greater#e94 than that which exists in rural parts of the country. In cities, such as#21#0 the capital Kabul, women are totally dependent#e95 on international aid for#17#0 survival. Ms. Atimadi says#e40 the women of Kabul symbolize#e351 the suffering of all the women in Afghanistan. The aim is to bring#e97 in not only the focus on women's right to education, access to work, but#14#0 look#e45 beyond that and#7#0 look#e46 at the roots of, uh of these problems. These are only the symptoms of the problems that are facing#e48 Afghanistan. For#18#0 women in Afghanistan to be able#e352 to realize#e51 their rights, there have to be conditions of peace and#8#0 justice. Ms. Atimadi says#e55 that is the primary focus of her group, peace and#9#0 justice. She says#e57 her group is appealing#e104 to individuals, to the international community, and#10#0 to the combatants and#11#0 people of Afghanistan to stop#e60 the bloodletting#e105 which has torn#e61 the country apart.
