RJR Is Selling @ Candy Brands X @ For#17#0  $  370 Million @-- X @ By Peter Waldman @ Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal 10/30/89 WALL STREET JOURNAL (J) RJR Z.NES TENDER OFFERS, MERGERS, ACQUISITIONS (TNM) FOOD PRODUCTS (FOD) RJR Nabisco Inc. said#e1 it agreed#e2 to sell#e4 its Baby Ruth, Butterfinger and#8#0 Pearson candy businesses to Nestle S.A.'s Nestle Foods unit for#18#0  $  370 million. The sale#e5, at a higher price than some analysts had expected#e7, helps#e8 the UCP food and#9#0 tobacco giant raise#e72 funds to pay#e10 debt and#10#0 boosts#e11 Nestle's 7 % share of the U.S. candy market to about 12 %. The candy businesses had#e75 sales#e76 of about  $  154 million last#t79>year#t79, which was roughly 12 % of total revenue for#19#0 RJR's Planters LifeSavers unit, according#e80 to a memorandum distributed#e14 by RJR's owner, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts amp Co., to bankers last#t82>December#t82. The Nestle acquisition includes a candy plant in Franklin Park, Ill., which employs about 800 workers. The sale#e17, which had been expected#e18, is part of KKR's program#e83 to pay#e20 down  $  5 billion of a  $  6 billion bridge loan by February#t85. Roughly  $  2 billion of that debt has already been repaid#e21 from previous asset sales, and#11#0 RJR expects#e23 to use#e24 another  $  2 billion from the pending, two-part sale#e25 of most of its Del Monte unit. That sale#e26, however#2#Comparison, could still#6#0 fall#e89 through if#26#0 financing problems develop#e29. Thus#7#Contingency, it remains crucial for#20#0 RJR to obtain top dollar for#21#0 its smaller assets like the candy brands. Louis Gerstner Jr., chairman and#12#0 chief executive officer of New York-based RJR, called the sale a `` significant step ''in the company's divestiture program, as#1#0 well#1#0 as#25#0 a `` a strategic divestiture. ''Since#5#0 KKR bought#e38 RJR in February#t91 for#22#0  $  25 billion of debt, it has agreed#e39 to sell#e41 nearly  $  5 billion of RJR assets. RJR's executives have said#e42 they will dispense#e43 with certain brands, in#0#0 particular#0#0, that aren't leaders#e93 in their markets.`` RJR Nabisco and#13#0 Planters LifeSavers will concentrate#e94 more on our own core businesses, ''Mr. Gerstner said#e50 Friday#t95. Baby Ruth and#14#0 Butterfinger are both among the top-selling 15 chocolate bars in the U.S., but#24#0 RJR's overall#3#0 share of the roughly  $  5.1 billion market is less than 5 %. Nestle's share of 7 % before#4#0 Friday#t99's purchases#e52 is far below the shares of market leaders Hershey Foods Corp. and#15#0 Mars Inc., which have about 40 % and#16#0 36 % of the market, respectively.`` This means Nestle is now in the candybar business in a big way, ''said#e61 Lisbeth Echeandia, publisher of Orlando, Fla.-based Confectioner Magazine.`` For#23#0 them, it makes all kinds of sense. They ve been given#e64 a mandate from Switzerland ''to expand#e67 their U.S. chocolate operations. Nestle S.A. is based in Vevey, Switzerland. The new candy bars, `` make#e69 an important contribution#e70 to our Nestle Foods commitment to this very important strategic unit, ''said#e71 C. Alan MacDonald, president of Nestle Foods in Purchase, N.Y.
