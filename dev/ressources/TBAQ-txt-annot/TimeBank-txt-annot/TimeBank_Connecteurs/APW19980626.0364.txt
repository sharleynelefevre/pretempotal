Parliamentary president Rita Suessmuth said#e6 the People's Union correctly listed#e7 Jacques de Mathan as#10#0 having donated#e8 about 274,500 marks in 1995#t41, but#9#0 gave#e9 a false address for#3#0 him. German law requires#e10 parties to publish#e11 the name and#7#0 address of anyone who donates#e12 more than 20,000 marks (dlrs 11,000). The anti-foreigner party said#e14 it wanted#e15 to protect#e16 the donor from possible attacks#e17. Suessmuth said#e36, however#0#Comparison, that the law does not allow#e20 for#4#0 providing#e22 a false address for#5#0 any reason. The fine is twice the donation, as#11#0 provided for#6#0 under German party financing laws. Party spokesman Bernd Droese said#e25 the People's Union would challenge#e26 the fine in court.
