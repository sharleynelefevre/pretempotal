The directors added#e13 that the two executives haven't reached#e14 a final decision#e16 to proceed#e18 with a bid#e19 and#23#Expansion that until#6#Temporal an offer#e20 is made#e22 the board will continue#e23 seeking#e24 higher offers from other bidders. The directors said#e26 if#39#0 Messrs. Drabinsky and#24#0 Gottlieb mail#e176 an offer#e180 to shareholders by Nov.#t179>22#t179, it will reimburse#e29 them a maximum of $, C$ 8.5 million for#8#0 expenses related to a bid.`` We consider#e33 that his bid is an acceptable bid, ''said#e36 Sandra Kolber, spokeswoman for#9#0 the independent directors committee appointed#e37 last#t183>May#t183 to solicit#e39 and#25#0 review#e40 bids for#10#0 the company in the wake of a dispute#e43 between Mr. Drabinsky and#26#0 Cineplex's major shareholder, MCA Inc. MCA holds half of Cineplex's equity and#27#0 33 % of its voting rights through restricted voting shares, while#5#0 Bronfman interests hold about 24 % of the company's equity. Ms. Kolber said#e55 the committee had received#e56 other bids. She declined#e58 to identify#e60 other bidders but#18#0 said#e61 Mr. Drabinsky's offer `` is all cash, and#28#0 it's for#11#0 all of the company. ''Several Cineplex analysts have speculated#e64 that outside bids received by the committee were UCP either#1#0 disappointingly low#e223 or#1#0 for#12#0 only part of the company.`` All this has really established is that MCA and#29#0 the Bronfmans have agreed#e68 on a price at which they can be bought#e70 out, ''said#e72 Jeffery Logsdon, an analyst with Crowell, Weedon in Los Angeles.`` If#40#0 a bid materializes#e74 at that price, shareholders will have every reason to be glad#e192, but#19#0 the question of financing still#4#0 remains#e81. ''Last#t193>April#t193, Mr. Drabinsky and#30#0 a group of financial backers planned#e82 to acquire#e84 up to 30.2 % of Cineplex for#13#0 $, C$ 17.50 a share from Bronfman associates. Mr. Drabinsky, who would have had#e195 the right to vote#e85 those shares for#14#0 two#t201>years#t201, said#e86 the purchase#e202, subsequently rejected#e88 by regulators, was aimed#e89 at consolidating#e91 his control of the company. MCA strongly opposed#e92 the Drabinsky group's move. The directors didn't indicate#e94 the source of financing for#15#0 Mr. Drabinsky's new proposal, but#20#0 said#e98 MCA and#31#0 the Bronfman associates agreed#e99 in principle to buy#e101 for#16#0  $  57 million and#32#0 then#7#0 lease#e207 back to Cineplex its 18-screen theater complex in Universal City, Calif., if#41#0 Mr. Drabinsky succeeds#e103 in an offer.`` This is being done#e106 at the suggestion#e107 of -LCB- Mr. Drabinsky -RCB- and#33#0 to accommodate#e110 him, to facilitate#e112 his financing arrangements#e208, ''Ms. Kolber said#e113. In#0#Expansion addition#0#Expansion, the directors said#e115 if#42#0 a bid by Mr. Drabinsky is successful#e209, Cineplex expects#e118 Rank Organisation PLC to acquire#e120 the 51 % of Cineplex's Film House unit it doesn't own#e211, and#34#0 provide#e122 Mr. Drabinsky with additional loan financing. Michael Gifford, Rank's chief executive, said#e124 the British theater chain's total involvement `` wouldn't exceed#e126  $  100 million ''but#21#0 declined#e129 to give#e131 a breakdown between the loan financing and#35#0 the proposed Film House purchase. Cineplex shareholders responded#e135 coolly to yesterday#t212's announcement#e136. In trading#e214 on the New York Stock Exchange, Cineplex closed#e138 at  $  11, down 25 cents, with more than a million shares changing hands. On the Toronto Stock Exchange, Cineplex closed#e141 at $, C$ 12.875, off 37.5 Canadian cents, well below the $, C$ 16.40 level.`` Where's the bid? ''asked Pierre Panet-Raymond, an analyst and#36#Expansion broker with Toronto securities dealer McDermid St. Lawrence Ltd. Mr. Panet-Raymond said#e144 he doesn't think#e145 Messrs. Drabinsky and#37#0 Gottlieb are `` anywhere close#e147 ''to arranging#e148 financing#e149 and#38#Expansion that investors will need#e150 a solid offer#e222 before#3#Temporal the stock begins#e153 to rise#e155 again.
