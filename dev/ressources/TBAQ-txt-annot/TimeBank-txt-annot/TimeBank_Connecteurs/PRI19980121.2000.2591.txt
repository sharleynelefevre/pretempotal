An officially sanctioned#e4 one, too. UNESCO declared#e5 it a protected site for#8#0 its beauty and#3#0 its historical significance. The city could have used#e6 some special protection in nineteen#t34>seventy-nine#t34 when#1#0 the Soviet Union invaded#e10 Afghanistan. Most of the city's monuments were destroyed#e11, including a magnificent tiled mosque, which dominated#e12 the skyline for#9#0 centuries#t1982. The people here are famous throughout central Asia for#10#0 their skill in fashioning pottery and#4#0 tile, glass too. Some families have kept#e1989 their glass working secrets for#11#0 more#t1991>than#t1991>two#t1991>thousand#t1991>years#t1991. Even though#0#0 this city is in Afghanistan, most people here speak#e19 a dialect of the Persian language, and#5#0 have#e22 long standing cultural ties with neighboring Iran. Think#e25 you got#e26 it? Well, frankly, I do nt, but#6#0 the answer is coming#e30 up in just a#t1986>few#t1986>minutes#t1986.
