Duty-Free Status Cleared @ For#2#0 Certain Watch Imports 11/02/89 WALL STREET JOURNAL (J) MONETARY NEWS, FOREIGN EXCHANGE, TRADE (MON) EXECUTIVE (EXE) WASHINGTON The White House said#e1 President Bush has approved#e2 duty-free treatment#e25 for#3#0 imports of certain types of watches that aren't produced#e3 in `` significant quantities ''in the U.S., the Virgin Islands and#11#0 other U.S. possessions. The action#e26 came#e5 in response to a petition filed#e6 by Timex Inc. for#4#0 changes in the U.S. Generalized System of Preferences for#5#0 imports from developing nations. Previously#0#0, watch imports were denied#e10 such duty-free treatment#e29. Timex had requested#e11 duty-free treatment for#6#0 many types of watches, covered by 58 different U.S. tariff classifications. The White House said#e13 Mr. Bush decided#e14 to grant#e15 duty-free status for#7#0 18 categories, but#16#0 turned#e16 down such treatment#e31 for#8#0 other types of watches `` because#1#0 of the potential for#9#0 material injury to watch producers located in the U.S. and#12#0 the Virgin Islands. ''Timex is a major U.S. producer#e32 and#13#0 seller#e33 of watches, including low-priced battery-operated watches assembled in the Philippines and#14#0 other developing nations covered by the U.S. tariff preferences. U.S. trade officials said#e22 the Philippines and#15#0 Thailand would be the main beneficiaries#e123 of the president's action#e34. Imports of the types of watches that now#t38 will be eligible#e39 for#10#0 duty-free treatment totaled#e23 about  $  37.3 million in 1988#t37, a relatively small share of the  $  1.5 billion in U.S. watch imports that#t1000>year#t1000, according#e40 to an aide to U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills.
