wsj_0768 Mutual Funds: @ Investors Yank Billions From Junk Funds X @-- X @ By Michael Siconolfi X X X @ Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal 10/27/89 WALL STREET JOURNAL (J) TROW MUTUAL AND#9#0 MONEY-MARKET FUNDS (FND) BOND MARKET NEWS (BON) NEW YORK Last#t174>week#t174 alone, an eye-popping  $  1.6 billion flowed#e7 out of the junk funds, or#30#0 nearly 5 % of their total assets, according#e167 to estimates by Dalbar Financial Services Inc., a Boston research firm. In the#t175>past#t175>two#t175>months#t175 the nation's 88 junk funds have lost#e9 a total of about  $  6 billion-- more than 15 % of assets-- through sales#e168 or#31#0 transfers#e169 of junk-fund shares, Dalbar says#e11. It made the estimates based on data collected from more than a dozen big junk funds. Interviews#e16 with three major fund groups-- Fidelity Investments, Vanguard Group Inc. and#10#0 T. Rowe Price Associates Inc.-- confirm#e17 the trend#e170. Their junk funds combined have had net outflows#e19 totaling nearly  $  500 million, or#32#0 about 13 % of their junk fund assets, in the#t176>past#t176>two#t176>months#t176. Some fund managers say#e22 negative publicity has exacerbated#e24 investors concern about recent#t185 declines#e179 in junk-bond prices.`` People have been seeing headline after#2#0 headline after#3#0 headline and#11#0 saying: ` I can't take it anymore-- I m getting out, ''''says#e37 Kurt Brouwer of Brouwer amp Janachowski, a San Francisco investment adviser. The withdrawals#e38 could spell#e39 trouble for#19#0 the  $  200 billion junk market. If#26#0 the heavy outflows#e43 continue#e44, fund managers will face#e46 increasing pressure#e180 to sell#e49 off some of their junk to pay#e51 departing investors in the#t186>weeks#t186>ahead#t186. Such selling#e53 could erode#e54 prices of high-yield junk bonds, RRC already weakened#e57 by a rash of corporate credit problems. Mutual fund groups haven't lost#e58 control of much of the outgoing money, says#e61 Louis Harvey, Dalbar's president. Mutual fund officials say#e62 that investors have transferred#e63 most of it into their money market accounts, and#12#0 to a lesser extent, government-bond funds. So#28#Contingency the impact#e66 on the  $  950 billion mutual fund industry as#23#0 a whole probably will be slight. But#8#Comparison tremors are likely in the junk-bond market, which has helped#e70 to finance#e72 the takeover boom#e73 of recent#t196>years#t196. Mutual funds are X the among the largest holders of junk, accounting for#20#0 more than a quarter of the entire high-yield, high-risk market. The 88 mutual funds investing solely in junk bonds hold assets of about  $  32 billion. Other funds hold a smattering of junk bonds, too. The  $  1.5 billion Fidelity High Income Fund has had a net outflow#e82 of about  $  150 million in the#t198>past#t198>two#t198>months#t198. About  $  60 million streamed#e83 out last#t199>week#t199 alone, double the level of the week#t201 following last#t200>month#t200's Campeau Corp. credit squeeze#e189. About 98 % of the outflow was transferred#e86 to other Fidelity funds, says#e87 Neal Litvack, a Fidelity vice president, marketing, with most going#e89 into money market funds.`` You get a news item, it hits, you have strong redemptions#e3000 UCP that day and#13#0 for#21#0 two days following-- then#6#0 go back to normal, ''says#e96 Mr. Litvack. The fund, with a cash cushion of more than 10 %, has ''met all the redemptions without having to sell one thing, ''Mr. Litvack says. He adds#e105: `` Our fund has had -LCB- positive -RCB- net sales#e195 every#t2332>month#t2332 for#22#0 the#t204>last#t204>three#t204>years#t204-- until#4#0 this#t205>month#t205. ''Vanguard's  $  1 billion High Yield Bond Portfolio has seen#e109  $  161 million flow#e110 out since#0#0 early#t206>September#t206;  $  14 million of that seeped#e208 out Friday#t210>Oct.#t210>13#t210 alone. Still#1#0, two-thirds of the outflow#e2371 has been steered#e112 into other Vanguard portfolios, says#e113 Brian Mattes, a vice president. The fund now#t211 holds#e116 a cash position of about 15 %. At the  $  932 million T. Rowe Price High Yield Fund, investors yanked#e117 out about  $  182 million in the#t213>past#t213>two#t213>months#t213. Those withdrawals#e118, most of which were transferred#e119 to other T. Rowe Price funds, followed little change#e121 in the fund's sales picture this#t214>year#t214 through August#t216.`` The#t217>last#t217>two#t217>months#t217 have been the whole ball game#e124, ''says#e125 Steven Norwitz, a vice president. Junk-fund holders have barely broken#e127 even this#t1997>year#t1997, as#24#0 fat interest payments barely managed#e129 to offset declining prices. Through Oct.#t1998>19#t1998, high-yield funds had#e1992 an average 0.85 % total return (the price change plus#5#0 dividends on fund shares), according#e1993 to Lipper Analytical Services Inc. That's even less than the 4.35 % total return of the Merrill Lynch High-Yield Index. Fidelity's junk fund has fallen#e133 2.08 % this#t2000>year#t2000 through Oct.#t2001>19#t2001, Lipper says#e134; the Vanguard fund rose#e135 1.84 %; and#14#0 the T. Rowe Price fund edged#e137 up 0.66 %. People who remain#e138 in junk funds now#t2003 could get#e140 hit#e142 again, some analysts and#15#0 fund specialists say#e143. Many funds in recent#t2004>weeks#t2004>and#16#0#t2004>months#t2004 have been selling#e144 their highest-quality junk issues, such as#25#0 RJR Nabisco, to raise#e146 cash to meet#e149 expected redemptions#e150. Funds might be forced#e152 to accept#e155 lower prices if#27#0 they expand#e157 their selling#e1996 to the securities of less-creditworthy borrowers. And#17#Expansion then#7#0, asset values of the funds could plunge#e160 more than they have so#29#0 far. Says Michael Hirsch, chief NX NX NX investment officer of Republic National Bank and#18#0 NX manager of the FundTrust Group in New York: `` It's a time bomb just waiting to go off. ''
