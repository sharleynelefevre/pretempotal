Letters to the Editor: @ Innovators Overlooked 11/01/89 WALL STREET JOURNAL (J) MUTUAL AND#0#0 MONEY-MARKET FUNDS (FND) I was pleased#e41 to note#e2 that your Oct.#t42>23#t42 Centennial Journal item recognized#e3 the money-fund concept as#6#0 one of the significant events of the past century. Actually, about#t39>two#t39>years#t39>ago#t39, the Journal listed#e4 the creation#e5 of the money fund as#7#0 one of the 10 most significant events in the world of finance in the#t40>20th#t40>century#t40. But#5#Comparison the Reserve Fund, America's first money fund, was not named#e9, nor#4#0 were the creators of the money-fund concept, Harry Brown and#1#0 myself. We innovated#e11 telephone redemptions#e29, daily dividends, total elimination#e30 of share certificates and#2#0 the constant  $  1 pershare pricing, all of which were painfully thought UCP#e15 out and#3#0 not the result of some inadvertence#e32 on the part of the SEC.
