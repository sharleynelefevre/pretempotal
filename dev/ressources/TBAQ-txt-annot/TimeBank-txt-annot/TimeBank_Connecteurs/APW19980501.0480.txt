APW19980501.0480 With the convergence#e8 of communications and#23#0 information technologies (IT) coupled with the coming#e139 of age for#12#0 the Internet and#24#0 its related technologies, the stage is set#e13 for#13#0 Malaysians to seize#e15 the chance to transform#e17 into a knowledge society and#25#0 become#e18 worthy opponents/players in the global market space. The Internet, the global network of computers, is now far reaching#e20 into the country- extending#e21 its embrace to include#e24 every nook and#26#0 cranny of the nation- opening#e154 doors to not only a diverse range of information sources but#38#0 also#6#0 an exhaustive list of possibilities to create#e28 new applications which add#e30 value to people's lives. In the business world, the Internet- through intranet and#27#0 extranet solutions- has become#e32 an invaluable tool for#14#0 companies to harness so#49#0 as#39#0 to gain#e35 a competitive edge. The solutions are also#7#Expansion vital components in developing#e38 the borderless marketing flagship application which is a vital element for#15#0 spearheading#e40 the development#e41 of the Multimedia Super Corridor (MSC) project. The application will create#e44 the necessary framework and#28#0 infrastructure to support#e46 electronic commerce (e-commerce) initiatives#e48 in the country. However#1#Comparison, it is important to note that installing#e51 or#46#0 implementing#e52 Internet technologies for#16#0 technology's sake would not ensure#e55 instant success#e58. For#17#0 e-commerce to flourish#e157 with full-blown end-to-end business transactions#e155, strategic planning#e156 which incorporates both business and#29#0 technology plans that are complementary is necessary for#18#0 an organisation to see#e159 feasible returns on investment. Intranets, through the use of Internet technology, are positioned#e142 as#40#0 a platform for#19#0 companies to optimise#e143, expand#e144 and#30#0 transform#e145 new channels of business. When#11#Contingency strategically implemented#e146, an intranet solution will provide#e147 the ability to mediate#e149 mission-critical, decision support functions in organisations. It will also#8#Expansion help#e86 further#4#0 improve#e150 communications and#31#0 collaboration at all levels in an organisation. With intranets in place, it is only logical for#20#0 organisations to respectively link#e151 the network to other companies ''for#21#0 extended business purposes through extranets. While#5#0 this will enable#e91 the sharing of information among enterprises, security issues such as#41#0 firewalls and#32#0 encryption as#3#0 well#3#0 as#42#0 access and#33#0 control procedures, and#34#0 the trust levels that enterprises have with each other will emerge#e99 and#35#0 there will be a need to address#e101 them. Other than usage#e102 in business, Internet technology is also#9#Expansion beginning#e105 to infiltrate#e107 the lifestyle domain.`` Smart homes ''have emerged#e108 bringing#e109 a wealth of information and#36#0 entertainment to families over telecommunications lines. The art of socialising is also#10#Expansion experiencing#e114 a change#e115 where Net/virtual relationships are fast overtaking#e116 or#47#0 becoming#e117 parallel with the normal human relationships. Whether this would prove#e118 UCP positive or#48#0 otherwise#0#0 towards society in the#t153>future#t153 is yet#22#0 to be seen#e121. All in all, the Internet has#e122 a lot to offer#e123. However#2#Comparison, its value and#37#0 benefits are only as#43#0 good as#44#0 how we use#e124 it.
