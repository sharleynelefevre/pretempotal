Columbia SampL Posts  $  226.3 Million Loss X @ After#9#Temporal Writing Down High-Yield Portfolio X @-- X @ By Pauline Yoshihashi @ Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal 10/26/89 WALL STREET JOURNAL (J) CSV EARNINGS (ERN) BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. Columbia Savings amp Loan Association, reeling#e1 from thrift-accounting changes#e2 mandated#e4 by Congress and#19#0 the recent collapse#e5 of the junk-bond market, announced#e7 a loss#e8 for#28#0 the#t164>third#t164>quarter#t164 of  $  226.3 million, or#39#0  $  11.57 a share. For#29#0 the#t165>quarter#t165>a#t165>year#t165>ago#t165, Columbia reported#e9 earnings of  $  16.3 million, or#40#0 37 cents a share. Total assets increased#e10 to  $  12.7 billion in the#t166>latest#t166>quarter#t166 from  $  12.4 billion a#t167>year#t167>earlier#4#0#t167. The loss#e11 stems#e12 from  $  357.5 million of write-downs#e168 on Columbia's  $  4.4 billion high-yield investment securities portfolio, which includes about  $  3.7 billion of junk bonds,  $  400 million of preferred stock, and#20#0 Treasury securities. Columbia owes#e15 its spectacular growth#e2022 in recent#t169>years#t169 to its junk-bond portfolio, the largest of any U.S. thrift. Much of Columbia's junk-bond trading#e17 has been done#e18 through the high-yield department of its Beverly Hills neighbor, Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. For#30#0 the#t170>nine#t170>months#t170, losses totaled#e19  $  212 million, or#41#0  $  10.83 a share, compared with net income of  $  48.7 million, or#42#0  $  1.11 a share, a#t172>year#t172>earlier#5#0#t172. The results include a  $  130.2 million write-down of the securities in the high-yield portfolio to the lower of their cost or#43#0 market value. Columbia also#12#Expansion added#e26  $  227.3 million to reserves for#31#0 losses#e1990 on the portfolio, increasing#e29 general reserves to  $  300 million, or#44#0 about 6.7 % of the total portfolio, as#33#0 of Sept.#t1991>30#t1991. On June#t1992>30#t1992, loss reserves stood#e31 at  $  108.3 million. Thrift officials said#e32 the  $  300 million reserve will be adjusted#e33 quarterly and#21#0 will reflect#e34 the rate of dispositions and#22#0 market conditions. The adjustments result#e37 from the recently passed#e1993 thrift-industry bailout legislation, which requires#e40 thrifts to divest#e42 all high-yield bond investments by 1994#t1994. Previously#0#0, Columbia didn't have to adjust#e47 the book value of its junk-bond holdings to reflect#e50 declines#e1997 in market prices, because#6#Contingency it held#e52 the bonds as#34#0 long-term investments. Because#7#Contingency Columbia now#t2151 must sell#e55 the bonds within five#t1999>years#t1999, accounting rules require#e58 the thrift to value#e60 the bonds at the lower of cost or#45#0 market prices. For#32#0 its future strategy, Columbia officials said#e62 the thrift may branch#e2000 out into commercial lending or#46#0 managing outside investments, as#3#0 well#3#0 as#35#0 beefing#e67 up more traditional thrift activities. The quarterly results also#13#Expansion reflected#e70  $  21.4 million in non-recurring losses from commercial real-estate activities in California. Thomas Spiegel, Columbia's chairman, said#e73 in a statement that the thrift was ''disappointed#e76 ''by the effects of the accounting changes#e77. But#18#Comparison he said#e78 Columbia remains#e79 `` one of the most strongly capitalized thrifts in the industry, ''based on the economic value of its NX NX assets and#23#0 NX tangible capital. Columbia announced#e84 the results after#10#0 the close#e2002 of the stock market. Its shares closed#e87 at  $  5.125 each in composite New York Stock Exchange trading, down 37.5 cents. The price of Columbia shares has been cut#e88 nearly in half since#11#0 August#t2004, when#16#0 they traded#e91 at about  $  10, as#36#0 investors apparently realized#e92 that the thrift would be forced#e93 to take#e96 a big write-down. The stock's decline#e2006 accelerated#e97 in the#t2007>past#t2007>two#t2007>weeks#t2007, from a price of  $  8 a share on Oct.#t2009>9#t2009. Columbia officials said#e99 they don't know#e100 how quickly they will dispose#e102 of the thrift's junk bonds, because#8#Contingency federal regulations, such as#37#0 those that would allow#e105 thrifts to continue#e108 holding#e109 the bonds in separately#1#0 capitalized subsidiaries, haven't yet#17#0 been completed#e111. Columbia officials also#14#Expansion said#e113 the thrift shouldn't face#e114 problems meeting regulatory capital requirements, despite the large reserves and#24#0 write-downs and#25#0 stiffer regulatory requirements that should be in place by year's#t2012>end#t2012. Its ratio of tangible equity to total assets as#38#0 of Sept.#t2013>30#t2013 was 3.6 %, and#26#0 total equity was  $  457.9 million. The thrift emphasized#e124 that it has#e125 a large portfolio of equity securities issued#e128 in connection with corporate restructurings and#27#0 leveraged buy-outs#e2015, which has#e130 a book value of  $  90 million. Although#2#Comparison many of the transactions related to those securities haven't been completed#e134, Columbia said#e136 the ultimate gain on the sale#e137 of those assets will range#e139 from  $  200 million to  $  300 million. Columbia also#15#Expansion has#e140 unrealized gains in its public equity securities portfolio of more than  $  70 million. David B. Hilder in New York contributed#e143 to this article.
