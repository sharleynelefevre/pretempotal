wsj_0810 Browning @ Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal 10/27/89 WALL STREET JOURNAL (J) F.CNM F.CFP G.ALL F.SGF F.CLC TENDER OFFERS, MERGERS, ACQUISITIONS (TNM) FOOD PRODUCTS (FOD) TRANSPORTATION, TRUCK AND#19#0 SHIP LINES, RAILROADS (TRA) INSURANCE (INS) PARIS At a news conference#e148, Mr. Fournier accused#e7 Paribas of planning#e8 to pay#e10 for#11#0 the takeover#e11 by selling parts of the company, WP$, whose interests include insurance, banking, tuna canning, sugar and#20#0 orange juice. The chairman said#e16 his board members, including representatives of West German insurance giant Allianz AG and#21#0 French banks Credit Lyonnais and#22#0 Societe Generale, hold#e17 nearly 50 % of Navigation Mixte's capital. Mr. Fournier said#e18 that as#40#0 Navigation Mixte chairman, he is prohibited#e19 by takeover regulations from organizing#e22 his own defense or#33#0 doing#e24 anything besides#3#0 managing#e25 current company business. But#28#Comparison sources said#e27 he will be urging#e28 his allies to boost#e30 their stakes in Navigation Mixte, which is being traded#e31 in London and#23#0 is to resume#e33 trading#e34 in Paris Tuesday#t153. At the same time, he is expected#e36 to seek#e38 UCP legal and#24#0 regulatory means of blocking#e40 or#34#0 delaying#e41 Paribas's bid#e42. For#12#0 the moment, the sources said#e43, he has decided#e44 against seeking#e45 a white knight or#35#0 organizing#e46 a counterbid#e156 for#13#0 Paribas. Mr. Fournier said#e47 Navigation Mixte's 1989#t157 unconsolidated, or#36#0 parent-company, profit is likely to be 4.7 billion francs ( $  754.4 million), up from 633.8 million francs last#t162>year#t162. That is due mostly to payments#e49 from Allianz for#14#0 most of the 50 % stake it has agreed#e51 to acquire#e53 in Navigation Mixte's insurance business. Mr. Fournier said#e55 the exceptional gain would mean#e2258 nearly twice as#41#0 high a dividend this#t163>year#t163 as#42#0 last#t167. If#37#0 holders avoid#e59 tendering#e60 to Paribas, he added#e61, they can expect#e62 strong dividends again next#10#0#t169>year#t169. Analysts noted#e64 that over the#t173>past#t173>20#t173>years#t173, Mr. Fournier has built#e65 his company through astute stock-market activity and#25#0 has warded#e68 off at least three takeover attempts#e69. This time, however#2#Comparison, some analysts think#e71 he could face#e177 a real battle#e72.`` Without some unexpected `` FW, coup FW, de FW, theatre "",, I don't see#e74 what will block#e76 the Paribas bid#e178, ''said#e77 Philippe FW, de Cholet, analyst at the brokerage Cholet-Dupont amp Cie. Mr. FW, de Cholet said#e79 Mr. Fournier's biggest hope was to somehow persuade#e81 regulatory authorities to block#e83 the bid#e84. Paribas still#5#0 needs the go-ahead from the FW, Commission FW, des FW, Operations FW, de FW, Bourse, a government regulatory agency, but#29#0 analysts said#e87 that is considered likely. Mr. Fournier also#9#Expansion noted#e89 that Navigation Mixte joined#e90 Paribas's core of shareholders when#8#0 Paribas was denationalized#e92 in 1987#t1994, and#26#0 said#e93 it now#t1995 holds#e94 just under 5 % of Paribas's shares. Once#7#Temporal he realized#e95 that Paribas's intentions weren't friendly, he said#e96, but#30#0 before#4#Temporal the bid#e97 was launched#e99, he sought#e100 approval#e101 to boost#e103 his Paribas stake above 10 %. The petition is still#6#0 pending#e105, but#31#0 Mr. Fournier downplayed#e106 the likelihood of his organizing#e107 a takeover bid#e108 of his own for#15#0 the much-larger Paribas. One big question now is the likely role of Mr. Fournier's allies. Mr. Fournier said#e111 the large institutions that hold nearly 50 % of Navigation Mixte's capital all strongly support#e113 him, but#32#0 some analysts said#e114 they aren't so#38#0 sure. Allianz, for#1#Expansion example#1#Expansion, has said#e115 in official comments so#39#0 far that it will remain#e118 neutral. Paribas is Allianz's lead French bank. Paribas said#e120 Monday#t2003 that it intends#e121 to bid#e122 to boost#e124 its stake in Navigation Mixte to 66.7 %, from the 18.7 % it already owns#e126. The purchase#e127 of the additional 48 % stake is expected#e129 to cost#e2010 more than 11 billion francs ( $  1.77 billion). Paribas says#e130 it will offer#e131 1,850 francs ( $  296.95) each for#16#0 Navigation Mixte shares that enjoy#e132 full dividend rights, and#27#0 1,800 francs each for#17#0 a block of shares issued July#t2011>1#t2011, which will receive#e134 only partial dividends this#t2012>year#t2012. Alternatively#0#0, it is to offer#e135 three Paribas shares for#18#0 one Navigation Mixte share. The Paribas offer values Navigation Mixte at about 23 billion francs, depending on WH how many of Navigation Mixte's warrants are converted into shares during the takeover battle.
