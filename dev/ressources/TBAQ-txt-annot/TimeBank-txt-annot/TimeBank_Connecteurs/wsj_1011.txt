Delta Air Net Rose X @ By 33 % to Record X @ In Fiscal 1st Period @-- X X @ By Bridget OBrian X X X @ Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal 10/26/89 WALL STREET JOURNAL (J) DAL AWAL EARNINGS (ERN) AIRLINES (AIR) Delta Air Lines earnings soared#e1 33 % to a record in the#t58>fiscal#t58>first#t58>quarter#t58, bucking#e3 the industry trend toward declining profits. The Atlanta-based airline, the third largest in the U.S., attributed#e5 the increase#e6 to higher passenger traffic, new international routes and#8#0 reduced service by rival Eastern Airlines, which is in bankruptcy proceedings#e9 in the wake of a strike#e12 that began#e13 last#t60>spring#t60. For#10#0 the#t65>quarter#t65 ended Sept.#t63>30#t63, Delta posted#e15 net income of  $  133.1 million, or#14#0  $  2.53 a share, up from  $  100 million, or#15#0  $  2.03 a share, a#t64>year#t64>earlier#2#0#t64. Revenue rose#e16 15 % to  $  2.17 billion from  $  1.89 billion. During the#t70>quarter#t70, Delta issued#e17 2.5 million shares of common stock to Swissair, and#9#0 repurchased#e18 1.1 million shares for#11#0 use#e19 in a company employee stock ownership plan.`` The key to Delta's record earnings continued#e21 to be excellent passenger revenue growth#e95, ''said#e23 Thomas Roeck, chief financial officer. Passenger traffic jumped#e25 14 % in the quarter, while#6#0 profit per passenger grew#e27 2 %. Delta has benefited#e28 more than other carriers from the weakness of Eastern Airlines, which shares#e29 the Atlanta hub. Although#1#Comparison Eastern is back to about 80 % of its pre-strike schedule now#t73, the Texas Air Corp. subsidiary was only beginning#e31 to get#e33 back on its feet during the#t74>quarter#t74. Separately#0#Expansion, America West Airlines, Phoenix, Ariz., reported#e34 third-quarter#t79 profit jumped#e35 45 % to  $  5.8 million, or#16#0 28 cents a share, from  $  4 million, or#17#0 24 cents a share, a#t88>year#t88>earlier#3#0#t88. The latest results include a  $  2.6 million one-time payment#e77 from a `` foreign entity. ''America West wouldn't identify#e38 the entity, but#7#0 said#e41 the payment#e42 was for#12#0 the foreign company's use#e43 of certain tax benefits in connection with America West plane purchases. Year-earlier#4#0#t80 results#e44 included an extraordinary gain#e82 of  $  1.6 million from a buy-back of convertible subordinated debentures. Revenue rose#e48 21 % to  $  243.4 million from  $  201.2 million. For#13#0 the#t87>nine#t87>months#t87, America West posted#e49 earnings of  $  18.9 million, or#18#0 97 cents a share, compared with a loss#e51 of  $  9.7 million, or#19#0 74 cents a share, a#t89>year#t89>earlier#5#0#t89. Revenue rose#e52 27 % to  $  715.1 million from  $  563.8 million.
