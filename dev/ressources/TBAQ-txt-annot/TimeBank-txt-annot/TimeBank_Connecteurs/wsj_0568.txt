wsj_0568 Unisys  $  648.2 Million 3rd-Period Loss @ Shows Intensified Fight for#29#0 Turnaround X @-- X X @ By Paul B. Carroll X X @ Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal 10/30/89 WALL STREET JOURNAL (J) UIS EARNINGS (ERN) COMPUTERS AND#36#0 INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (CPR) At the same time, the sheer size of the loss#e11, coupled with a slowing of orders#e13, made#e14 some securities analysts wonder#e16 WH just how strong that turnaround will be at the computer maker and#37#0 defense-electronics concern.`` Unisys is getting#e17 clobbered#e18. Just clobbered, ''said#e20 Ulric Weil, an analyst at Weil amp Associates who had once#22#0 been high#e2785 on the company.`` The quarter was terrible, and#38#0 the future looks anything but#23#0 encouraging. ''Unisys, WP$, whose revenue inched#e22 up 3.7 % in the#t2135>quarter#t2135 to  $  2.35 billion from  $  2.27 billion in the#t225>year-earlier#6#0#t225>quarter#t225, had#e226 an operating loss#e23 of about  $  30 million. On top of that, the NAC Blue Bell, Pa., concern took#e24 a  $  230 million charge#e227 related to the layoffs#e26 of 8,000 employees. That is at the high end of the range of 7,000 to 8,000 employees that Unisys said#e28 a#t228>month#t228>ago#t228 would be laid#e29 off. Unisys said#e31 that should help#e32 it save#e34  $  500 million a year in costs, again at the high end of the previously#3#0 reported range of  $  400 million to  $  500 million. The company also#18#Expansion took#e37 a write-off#e38 of  $  150 million to cover#e40 losses#e229 on some fixed-price defense contracts, as#44#0 some new managers took#e43 a hard look#e44 at the prospects for#30#0 that slow-growing business. In#0#Expansion addition#0#Expansion, Unisys set#e47 up an unspecified reserve-- apparently  $  60 million to  $  70 million-- to cover#e49 the minimum amount it will have to pay#e52 the government because#4#0 of its involvement#e53 in the defense-procurement scandal#e54. Unisys also#19#Expansion noted#e56 that it paid#e57  $  78.8 million in taxes during the#t235>quarter#t235, even though#10#0 tax payments#e3000 normally would be minimal in a quarter that produced such a big loss. The tax payments will leave#e64 Unisys with  $  225 million in loss carry-forwards that will cut#e67 tax payments#e68 in future#t237>quarters#t237. In#1#Expansion addition#1#Expansion, Unisys said#e70 it reduced#e2328 computer inventories a further#8#0  $  100 million during the#t239>quarter#t239, leaving#e73 it within  $  100 million of its goal of a reduction#e241 of  $  500 million by the#t243>end#t243>of#t243>the#t243>year#t243. Still#11#Comparison, Unisys said#e76 its European business was weak#e244 during the#t246>quarter#t246, a worrisome sign given that the company has relied#e80 on solid results overseas to overcome#e84 weakness in the U.S. over the#t249>past#t249>several#t249>quarters#t249. The company also#20#Expansion reported#e85 slower growth#e250 in another important business: systems that use the Unix operating system. That would be a huge problem#e2410 if#49#0 it were to continue#e2409, because#5#Contingency Unisys is betting#e2405 its business on the assumption that customers want#e2407 to move#e2408 away from using operating systems that run on only one manufacturer's equipment and#39#0 toward systems-- mainly Unix-- that work on almost anyone's machines. In#2#Expansion addition#2#Expansion, Unisys must deal#e105 with its increasingly oppressive debt load. Debt has risen#e107 to around  $  4 billion, or#50#0 about 50 % of total capitalization. That means Unisys must pay#e110 about  $  100 million in interest every#t256>quarter#t256, on top of  $  27 million in dividends on preferred stock. Jim Unruh, Unisys's president, said#e115 he is approaching#e116 next#13#0 year with caution. He said#e118 the strength of the world-wide economy is suspect#e1991, and#40#0 doesn't see much revenue growth in the cards. He also#21#Expansion said#e124 that the price wars flaring#e126 up in parts of the computer industry will continue#e128 through next#14#0#t259>year#t259. He said#e129 the move#e1992 toward standard operating systems means customers aren't locked#e1993 into buying from their traditional computer supplier and#41#0 can force prices down. That, he said#e138, is why Unisys is overhauling#e139 its whole business: It needs#e141 to prepare#e143 for#31#0 a world in which profit margins will be lower#e1995 than computer companies have been used#e145 to.`` We ve approached#e146 this not as#45#0 a response to a temporary condition in the industry but#24#0 as#46#0 a fundamental change the industry is going through, ''Mr. Unruh said#e152.`` The information-systems industry is still#12#0 going to be a high-growth business#e1997, and#42#0 we're confident#e1996 that we have#e157 tremendous assets as#47#0 a company. But#25#Comparison we don't minimize#e158 the challenges#e160 of the#t1998>near#t1998>term#t1998. ''Securities analysts were even more cautious#e1999, having been burned#e162 repeatedly on Unisys this#t2000>year#t2000. Some had predicted#e163 earnings#e2784 of more than  $  4 a share for#32#0 this#t2003>year#t2003, up from last#t2008>year#t2008's fully diluted  $  3.27 a share on earnings of  $  680.6 million. But#26#Comparison the company said#e165 Friday#t2009 that it had#e166 losses#e2010 of  $  673.3 million through the#t2012>first#t2012>nine#t2012>months#t2012, compared with earnings#e2015 a#t2013>year#t2013 earlier#7#0 of  $  382.2 million, or#51#0  $  2.22 a share fully diluted, as#48#0 revenue inched#e169 up 1.4 % to  $  7.13 billion from  $  7.03 billion. And#43#Expansion Unisys is expected#e170 to do#e172 little better than break even in the#t2021>fourth#t2021>quarter#t2021. So#52#Contingency Steve Milunovich at First Boston said#e174 he is cutting#e175 his earnings estimate#e2709 for#33#0 next#15#0#t2022>year#t2022 to  $  2 a share from  $  3.`` I was feeling like I was too high to begin with, ''he said#e3001. Mr. Weil of Weil amp Associates said he will remain#e181 at  $  1 a share for#34#0 next#16#0#t2029>year#t2029 but#27#0 said#e182 he wonders#e183 whether even that low target is at#e2794 risk.`` The break-even point for#35#0 next#17#0#t2034>year#t2034 is much lower#e2032, but#28#0 is it low#e2795 enough? ''he asked#e187. Reflecting the concern, Unisys stock fell#e189 a further#9#0 75 cents to  $  16.25 in composite trading Friday#t2038 on the New York Stock Exchange.
