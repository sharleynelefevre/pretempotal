International: X X @ Courtaulds PLC @ Plans to Spin Off @ Textiles Business @-- X X @ By Craig Forman X X @ Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal 10/31/89 WALL STREET JOURNAL (J) COU DIVIDENDS (DIV) STOCK MARKET, OFFERINGS (STK) TEXTILES AND#13#0 APPAREL (TEX) LONDON Courtaulds PLC announced#e1 plans#e85 to spin#e3 off its textiles operations to existing shareholders in a restructuring#e86 to boost#e8 shareholder value. The British UCP chemical and#14#0 textile company's plan, which requires shareholder approval, would create#e11 NX a new, listed U.K. stock with a probable market capitalization between 300 million ( $  473 million) and#15#0 400 million, analysts said#e15. The establishment#e16 of the separate company, to be called Courtaulds Textiles, could be effective as#23#0 early as#24#0 next#11#0#t90>year's#t90>first#t90>quarter#t90. Investors welcomed#e20 the move#e21. Courtaulds shares rose#e22 15 pence to 362 pence, valuing the entire company at about 1.44 billion. Courtaulds spinoff#e93 reflects pressure on British industry to boost share prices beyond the reach of corporate raiders. Courtaulds restructuring#e94 is among the largest thus#12#0 far in Britain, though#6#0 it is dwarfed by B.A.T Industries PLC's plans#e95 to spin#e31 roughly off 4 billion in assets to help#e33 fend#e34 off a takeover bid from Anglo-French financier Sir James Goldsmith. The divested Courtaulds textile operations had#e96 operating profit#e97 of 50 million on 980 million in revenue in the#t99>year#t99 ended March#t100>31#t100. Some analysts have said#e37 Courtaulds moves#e38 could boost#e39 the company's value by 5 % to 10 %, because#3#Contingency the two entities separately#1#0 will carry#e41 a higher price earnings multiple than they did combined#e103. In#0#Expansion addition#0#Expansion, Courtaulds said#e45 the moves#e46 are logical because#4#Contingency they will allow#e47 both the chemicals and#16#0 textile businesses to focus#e104 more closely on core activities. Courtaulds has been under#e119 pressure to enhance#e54 shareholder value since#9#0 takeover speculators-- including Australian financier Kerry Packer-- surfaced#e55 holding small stakes last#t108>year#t108. Though#7#0 Mr. Packer has since#10#0 sold#e58 his stake, Courtaulds is moving#e60 to keep#e62 its institutional shareholders happy. Even without a specific takeover threat, Courtaulds is giving#e64 shareholders `` choice and#17#0 value, ''said#e66 Julia Blake, an analyst at London stockbrokers Barclays de Zoete Wedd. In a statement, the company said: `` Both parts can only realize their full potential and#18#0 be appropriately valued by the market if#22#0 they are separately#2#0 quoted companies. The sharper definition and#19#0 the autonomy which each will thereby#5#0 gain will benefit shareholders, customers and#20#0 employees. ''Courtaulds Chairman and#21#0 Chief Executive Sir Christopher Hogg will remain#e77 in both posts at the surviving chemical company after#8#0 the spinoff.
