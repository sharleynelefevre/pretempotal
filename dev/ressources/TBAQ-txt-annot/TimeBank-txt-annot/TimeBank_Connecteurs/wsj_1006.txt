wsj_1006 Provigo Will Sell Non-Food FW, Operations FW, @ To Concentrate on Grocery Business X @-- X X @ By G. Pierre Goad X X @ Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal 10/26/89 WALL STREET JOURNAL (J) T.PGI WNEWS TENDER OFFERS, MERGERS, ACQUISITIONS (TNM) MONTREAL The non-food operations accounted#e12 for#21#0 about 27 % of Provigo's 7.38 billion Canadian dollars ($, US$ 6.3 billion) in sales in the#t177>latest#t177>fiscal#t177>year#t177. In a related move#e14, Pierre Lortie, chairman and#6#0 chief executive, resigned#e15. Mr. Lortie joined#e16 Provigo in 1985#t141 and#7#0 spearheaded#e17 the company's drive#e18 to grow#e20 outside its traditional food business. He couldn't be reached#e22 for#22#0 comment. Bertin Nadeau, newly appointed#e26 chairman and#8#0 interim chief executive of Provigo, wouldn't say#e27 if#29#0 Mr. Lortie was asked#e31 to leave#e33.`` Mr. Lortie felt#e34 less pertinent, ''Mr. Nadeau said#e35, given the decision#e37 to dump#e39 Provigo's non-food operations.`` At this stage it was felt#e41 I was perhaps more pertinent as#26#0 chief executive. ''Mr. Nadeau also#5#Expansion is chairman and#9#0 chief executive of Unigesco Inc., Provigo's controlling shareholder. At a news conference, Mr. Nadeau said#e43 the sale#e44 of the three non-food businesses, which account for#23#0 nearly half the company's $, C$ 900 million in assets, should be completed#e47 in a `` matter of months. ''The three units are a nationwide UCP pharmaceutical and#10#0 health-products distributor, a small sporting-goods chain, and#11#Expansion a combination catalog showroom and#12#0 toy-store chain. Investors and#13#0 analysts applauded#e50 the news. Provigo was the most active industrial stock on the Montreal Exchange, where it closed#e52 at $, C$ 9.75 ($, US$ 8.32), up 75 Canadian cents.`` I think#e53 it's a pretty positive development#e146, ''said#e55 Ross Cowan, a financial analyst with Levesque Beaubien Geoffrion Inc., of the decision#e56 to concentrate#e58 on groceries. Mr. Lortie's departure#e59, while#4#0 sudden, was seen#e61 as#27#0 inevitable#e328 in light of the shift#e63 in strategy.`` The non-food operations were largely Mr. Lortie's creation -LCB- and#14#0 -RCB- his strategy didn't work#e66, ''said#e68 Steven Holt, a financial analyst with Midland Doherty Ltd. For#24#0 the#t148>six#t148>months#t148 ended#e71 Aug.#t149>12#t149, Provigo posted#e72 net income of $, C$ 6.5 million, or#31#0 eight Canadian cents a share, compared with $, C$ 18.1 million, or#32#0 21 Canadian cents a share, a#t150>year#t150>earlier#1#0#t150. Sales were $, C$ 4.2 billion compared with $, C$ 3.7 billion. Last#t151>month#t151, Canadian Bond Rating Service downgraded#e76 Provigo's commercial paper and#15#0 debentures because#0#0 of its lackluster performance#e79. Analysts are skeptical#e157 Provigo will be able to sell#e81 the non-food businesses as#28#0 a group for#25#0 at least book value, and#16#0 are expecting#e84 write-downs#e158. Mr. Nadeau said#e85 he couldn't yet#20#0 say#e86 if#30#0 the sale prices would match#e90 book values. He said#e92 all three non-food operations are profitable#e156. Mr. Nadeau said#e94 discussions#e95 are under way with potential purchasers of each of the units. He declined#e97 to confirm#e99 or#33#0 deny#e100 reports#e101 that Provigo executive Henri Roy is trying#e102 to put#e104 together a management buy-out#e159 of the catalogue showroom unit. Mr. Roy couldn't be reached#e105. Yvon Bussieres was named#e108 senior NX NX executive vice president and#17#0 NX chief operating officer of Provigo, a new position. Mr. Bussieres was president and#18#0 chief operating officer of Provigo's Quebec retail and#19#0 wholesale grocery unit. Mr. Nadeau said#e110 he intends#e111 to remain#e113 Provigo's chief executive only until#3#0 the non-food businesses are sold#e116, after#2#0 a which a new chief executive will be named#e117.
