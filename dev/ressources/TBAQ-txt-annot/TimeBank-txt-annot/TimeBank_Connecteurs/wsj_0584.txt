BellSouth, LIN @ Sweeten Plan @ To Merge Lines X @-- X @ Accord Involves Huge Debt@ And#29#0 May Fail to Thwart @ Rival Suitor McCaw @-- X @ By Julie Amparano Lopez @ Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal 10/30/89 WALL STREET JOURNAL (J) BLS LINB MCAWA TENDER OFFERS, MERGERS, ACQUISITIONS (TNM) TELEPHONE SYSTEMS (TLS) MEDIA, PUBLISHING, BROADCASTING, ELECTRONIC PUBLISHING (MED) The bolstered cellular agreement between BellSouth Corp. and#30#0 LIN Broadcasting Corp. carries heightened risks and#31#0 could fail#e4 to fend#e7 off McCaw Cellular Communications Inc., the rival suitor for#42#0 LIN. Moreover#4#Expansion, the amended pact shows how McCaw's persistence has pushed#e10 LIN and#32#0 BellSouth into a corner, forcing#e12 huge debt on the proposed new company. The debt, estimated#e13 at  $  4.7 billion, could mortgage#e14 the cellular company's future earning power in order to placate#e19 some LIN holders in the#t287>short#t287>term#t287. The plan still#16#0 calls#e21 for#43#0 LIN to combine#e23 its cellular telephone properties with BellSouth's and#33#0 to spin#e25 off its broadcasting operations. But#24#Comparison under new terms of the agreement, announced#e28 Friday#t288, LIN holders would receive#e29 a special cash dividend of  $  42 a share, representing a payout of about  $  2.23 billion, shortly before#13#0 the proposed merger#e32. LIN said#e34 it expects#e35 to borrow#e37 the money to pay#e40 the dividend, but#25#0 commitments#e41 from banks still#17#0 haven't been obtained#e43. Under previous terms, holders would have received#e45 a dividend of only  $  20 a share. In#0#Expansion addition#0#Expansion, New York-based LIN would exercise#e48 its right to buy#e51 out for#44#0  $  1.9 billion the 55 % equity interest of its partner, Metromedia Co., in a New York cellular franchise. That money also#21#Expansion would have to be borrowed#e56. In effect, McCaw has forced#e57 LIN's hand by bidding#e58  $  1.9 billion for#45#0 the stake earlier#9#0#t292>this#t292>month#t292.`` We're taking#e60 on more debt than we would have liked#e61 to, ''acknowledged#e63 Michael Plouf, LIN's NX NX vice president and#34#0 NX treasurer. Although#5#Comparison he expressed#e65 confidence that the proposed new company's cash flow would be sufficient#e294 to cover#e69 interest payments on the debt, he estimated#e71 that the company wouldn't be profitable#e295 until#20#0 1994#t299>or#56#0#t299>later#14#0#t299. Analyst estimate#e74 the value of the BellSouth proposal at about  $  115 to  $  125 a share. They value#e301 McCaw's bid#e76 at  $  112 to  $  118 a share. The previous BellSouth pact was valued#e77 at about  $  98 to  $  110 a share. McCaw, the largest provider of cellular telephone service in the U.S., already owns about 9.4 % of LIN's stock. In response to BellSouth's amended pact, the NAC Kirkland, Wash., company extended#e81 its own offer#e82 to buy#e84 22 million LIN shares for#46#0  $  125 apiece, which would give#e85 McCaw a 50.3 % controlling interest. Over the#t307>weekend#t307, McCaw continued#e88 to call#e90 for#47#0 an auction of LIN. Analysts said#e91 they expect#e92 McCaw to escalate#e94 the bidding again.`` This game isn't over yet#40#0, ''said#e98 Joel D. Gross, a vice president at Donaldson, Lufkin amp Jenrette Securities Corp. `` NX At some point, it will become#e100 non-economical for#48#0 one company. But#26#Comparison I don't think#e101 we're at that point yet#41#0. ''Under its revised proposal#e104, Atlanta-based BellSouth would have#e316 a 50 % interest in the new cellular company and#35#0 would be responsible#e317 for#49#0 half of its debt. To sweeten#e107 the pact further#10#0-- and#36#0 to ease#e110 concerns of institutional investors-- BellSouth added#e111 a provision designed to give#e115 extra protection to holders if#61#0 the regional Bell company ever decides#e118 to buy#e120 the rest of the new cellular company. The provision, described as#52#0 `` back-end ''protection, would require#e125 BellSouth to pay#e128 a price equivalent to what an outside party might have to pay. McCaw's bid also#22#Expansion has a similar clause. Only McCaw's proposal requires#e138 the company to begin#e140 an auction process#e141 in June#t322>1994#t322 for#50#0 remaining shares at third-party prices. To mollify#e144 shareholders concerned#e145 about the long-term value of the company under the BellSouth-LIN agreement, BellSouth also#23#Expansion agreed#e147 to pay#e149 as#53#0 much#6#0 as#6#0  $  10 a share, or#57#0  $  540 million, if#62#0, after#19#0 five#t326>years#t326, the trading value of the new cellular company isn't as#54#0 high as#55#0 the value that shareholders would have realized from the McCaw offer.`` We're very pleased#e329 with the new deal. We didn't expect#e154 BellSouth to be so#60#0 responsive#e330, ''said#e157 Frederick A. Moran, president of Moran Asset Management Inc., which holds 500,000 LIN shares. BellSouth's `` back-end protection was flawed previously#1#0. We think#e161 this is a superior deal to McCaw s. We're surprised. We didn't think#e164 a sleeping -LCB- Bell -RCB- mentality would be willing#e332 to take#e168 on dilution. ''But#27#Comparison Kenneth Leon, a telecommunications analyst with Bear, Stearns amp Co., finds#e170 the BellSouth proposal still#18#0 flawed#e171 because#7#Contingency the company doesn't have to wait#e2025 five years to begin buying more LIN shares.`` WH How many shares will be around in 1995? ''he asked.`` There's nothing preventing BellSouth from buying up shares in the meanwhile#3#0. ''BellSouth's revised proposal#e183 surprised#e184 many industry analysts, especially because#8#0 of the company's willingness to accept#e187 some dilution of future earnings. William O. McCoy, president of the company's BellSouth Enterprises Inc. unit, said#e189 the revised agreement#e190 with LIN would dilute#e191 BellSouth earnings by about 9 % in both 1990#t351 and#37#0 1991#t352 and#38#0 by significantly less thereafter#2#0. Indeed#11#Expansion, BellSouth's cellular operations were among the first in the country to become profitable. For#51#0 1988#t358, BellSouth earned#e196  $  1.7 billion, or#58#0  $  3.51 a share, on revenue of  $  13.6 billion. Analysts were predicting#e197 1990#t359 BellSouth earnings in the range of  $  3.90 a share, or#59#0  $  1.9 billion, but#28#0 now#t361 those estimates#e362 are being scaled#e200 back. In composite trading#e363 Friday#t364 on the New York Stock Exchange, BellSouth shares fell#e201 87.5 cents to  $  52.125. In national over-the-counter trading#e202, LIN shares soared#e203 NX  $  4.625 to closed at  $  112.625, while#15#0 McCaw fell#e206  $  2.50 a share to  $  37.75. The proposed BellSouth-LIN cellular company, including the newly acquired Metromedia stake, would give#e207 the new entity 55 million potential customers, including about 35 million in the nation's top 10 markets. Mr. Leon of Bear Stearns speculated#e211 that McCaw, in an attempt#e212 to buy#e215 time, might consider#e217 filing#e219 an antitrust suit against BellSouth with the Justice Department and#39#0 U.S. District Judge Harold Greene, who oversees enforcement of the consent decree that broke#e224 up the Bell system in 1984#t370. Indeed#12#Expansion, McCaw seemed#e225 to hint#e227 at that option in a brief statement#e230. Urging LIN directors to conduct `` a fair auction on a level playing field, ''McCaw asked how well the public interest would be served `` with the Bell operating companies controlling over 94 % of all cellular -LCB- potential customers -RCB- in the nation's top 10 markets.
