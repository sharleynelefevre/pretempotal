AP900816-0139 No pickup LaserPhotos By ROBERT DVORCHAK Associated Press Writer Bush, commenting#e7 on the two-week#t289 gulf crisis#e8 from his vacation home in Maine, said#e11 he saw#e12 little reason to be optimistic#e205 about a settlement#e206 of the dispute#e207, which stems#e13 from Iraq's invasion#e208 of oil-wealthy Kuwait and#25#0 its subsequent military buildup#e209 on the border of Saudi Arabia. After#10#0 a two-hour#t290 meeting#e210 at his Kennebunkport home with King Hussein of Jordan, Bush said#e14, `` I did not come#e15 away with any feeling of hope ''that Iraq would withdraw#e17 its army from Kuwait. Bush also#17#Expansion said#e19 Thursday#t291 that King Hussein assured#e20 him Jordan would close#e21 the last remaining free port to most Iraqi trade as#70#0 the economic embargo#e213 on materials to Iraq continued#e25 unabated. Foodstuffs are among the goods being blocked#e26 from entry; Iraq imports about three-quarters of its food. Pentagon sources in Washington meanwhile#2#0 said#e29 the Bush administration plans#e216 to deploy#e30 45,000 Marines to the region to back#e217 up the thousands of Army, Navy and#26#0 Air Force troops already in place in the gulf and#27#0 the Saudi desert. At a news conference#e220, NAC Secretary of State James A. Baker III said#e32 Jordan `` is seeking#e33 some guidance ''about a provision in the U.N.-backed trade embargo that allows#e35 food for#57#0 humanitarian purposes. Worries however#5#Comparison grew#e36 about the safety of Americans and#28#0 other Westerners trapped#e37 in Kuwait. Iraqi military authorities ordered#e38 all Americans and#29#0 Britons in Kuwait to assemble#e39 at a hotel, officials said#e40.`` Very few ''of the 2,500 Americans in occupied Kuwait complied#e41 with the order, a senior U.S. official told#e42 The Associated Press. Iraq said#e43 the roundup#e225 was to protect#e44 them from unspecified threats#e45; British Foreign Office minister William Waldegrave called#e47 the order `` grave and#30#0 sinister. ''`` What we fear#e227 is that they will be interned#e48 somewhere, most likely in Iraq, ''Waldegrave said#e49. A total of about 3,000 Americans, 3,000 Britons and#31#0 more than 450 Japanese are in Iraq and#32#0 Kuwait. Overall#4#0, more than 2 million foreigners are in both countries. Iraq has called them `` restrictees. ''In#0#0 addition#0#0 to the estimated 45,000 Marines to ultimately#1#0 be part of Operation Desert Shield, Stealth fighter planes and#33#0 the aircraft carrier John F. Kennedy are also#18#Expansion headed#e51 to Saudi Arabia to protect#e52 it from Iraqi expansionism. In Washington, Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams said#e53 Iraq has continued#e54 to increase#e55 its armed forces in Kuwait and#34#0 they now#t316 number about 160,000. Saddam has been under international quarantine since#12#0 his Aug.#t292>2#t292 power-grab#e239, or#68#0 what he calls#e56 an `` eternal merger#e1507 ''with Kuwait. In a long verbal attack#e237 read on Iraqi television Thursday#t293, Saddam repeatedly called#e57 Bush `` a liar ''and#35#0 said#e58 a shooting war#e242 could produce#e59 body bags courtesy of Baghdad.`` We continue#e61 to pray#e320 and#36#0 pray#e63 hard to God so#8#0 that#8#0 there will be no confrontation#e64 whereby you will receive#e65 thousands of Americans wrapped in sad coffins after#11#Temporal you had pushed#e67 them into a dark tunnel, ''Saddam said#e69. He called#e70 U.S. soldiers massing#e71 in Saudi Arabia the real occupiers in the Persian Gulf. Replied#e72 State Department deputy spokesman Richard Boucher, `` We haven't really analyzed#e73 the statement in detail but#63#0 it appears#e76 to be just another example of his outlandish rhetoric and#37#0 his attempts#e246 to distort#e77 the truth.`` We believe#e78 that his words can not distract#e80 the world from the facts of Iraqi aggression. ''An international land, sea and#38#0 air force has mobilized#e83 since#13#0 Iraq's invasion#e249, which was sparked#e84 by disputes#e250 over oil, land and#39#0 repayment of war loans. In the largest U.S. military operation#e251 since#14#0 Vietnam, an estimated 20,000 American GIs have already massed#e85 to defend#e86 Saudi Arabia.`` We don't just arrive#e87, ''said#e89 four-star Gen. John Dailey, assistant commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps.`` We're there to stay#e90 for#58#0 a#t339>fairly#t339>lengthy#t339>period#t339. ''Egypt, Syria, Morocco and#40#0 Bangladesh also#19#Expansion committed#e91 ground troops, to a much lesser degree. The U.S. Navy has#e253 27 ships in the maritime barricade of Iraq. They are aided#e254 by Britain, West Germany, Australia, Canada, the Netherlands and#41#0 Belgium. Bush was expected#e95 to authorize#e96 naval commanders to use#e97 `` the minimum force necessary ''to interdict#e98 shipments to and#42#0 from Iraq, a U.S. official said#e99. That could include firing#e255 across the bow to halt#e256 a ship. In the air, U.S. Air Force fliers say#e102 they have engaged#e103 in `` a little cat and#43#0 mouse ''with Iraqi warplanes, which have retreated#e104 when#15#0 weapons radar locks#e257 onto them.`` They don't want#e107 to play#e109 with us, ''one U.S. crew chief said#e110. In Kuwait, the Iraqis have rimmed#e111 the capital city with an air-defense system, according#e258 to a U.S. official who spoke on the condition of anonymity. He declined#e114 to say#e115 if#67#0 the weapons included#e117 missiles, but#64#0 the Iraqis have them in their arsenal. The Iraqis also#20#Expansion possess chemical weapons. The combined operations#e1138 are designed to isolate#e122 and#44#0 strangle#e259 Iraq until#9#Temporal it retreats#e123 from Kuwait. The quarantine hopes#e125 to staunch#e126 the flow#e261 of Iraqi oil, which is Iraq's economic lifeblood, and#45#0 clamp#e127 down on food and#46#0 supplies going#e128 in. Iraq now#t295 controls#e129 20 percent of the world's oil reserves with its conquest#e262 of Kuwait. Only Saudi Arabia has#e263 more oil reserves. The economic chokehold#e1214 appears to be working. The Lloyd's List International newspaper, which monitors worldwide shipping, said#e134 Iraq's fleet of 80 tankers and#47#0 cargo ships has stopped#e135 regular trading#e136. John Prescott, a shipping correspondent, said#e137 there was no shipping#e138 in Kuwaiti or#69#0 Iraqi ports and#48#Expansion that activity was trailing#e139 off in the Jordanian port of Aqaba. Bush's chief objective in his meeting#e140 with Hussein was to press#e266 the king to shut#e142 down Iraq's food and#49#0 oil supply route from Aqaba on the Red Sea. Aqaba is Iraq's only outlet#e267 now#t299 that an international noose has tightened#e143. Bush has indicated#e144 the U.S. Navy will barricade#e145 the port from Iraqi ships. The president also#21#Expansion has offered#e147 to help#e148 offset#e149 Jordan's costs because#7#Contingency 40 percent of its exports go#e1307 to Iraq and#50#0 90 percent of its oil comes#e1306 from there.`` It's our only outlet to the sea and#51#0 the rest of the world, ''Hussein said#e152. He also#22#Expansion said#e153 of trade with Iraq: `` There are no shipments at the moment. ''A#t352>day#t352>earlier#6#0#t352, scores of trucks, many with Iraqi license plates, streamed#e156 north out of Aqaba to Amman and#52#0 onto the desert highway bound for#59#0 Iraq. The Jordanian monarch met#e158 this#t300>week#t300 with Saddam, but#65#0 he told#e159 reporters he had no message from Baghdad.`` I am not talking#e161 on behalf of anyone in the area.. but#66#0 myself, ''Hussein said#e165. In the United Nations, Libya called#e166 for#60#0 the replacement#e271 of U.S. forces in the Persian Gulf with Arab League forces and#53#0 U.N. soldiers. Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi, in a letter to the U.N. Secretary-General, also#23#Expansion called#e169 for#61#0 an emergency Security Council meeting#e272 in Geneva to remove#e170 U.S. forces. There was no decision#e171 on a meeting#e173. Thirty-two of the 159 U.N. members had filed#e175 compliance reports by Wednesday#t301, and#54#0 all were honoring#e274 the sanctions Iraq. Also#24#Expansion Thursday#t302, Saudi Arabia called#e177 for#62#0 an emergency conference#e276 of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to discuss#e178 WH how much oil to pump#e179. The minister denied#e180 the kingdom had notified#e3000 notified any of its customers of any cutbacks#e278 in oil supply. Reports attributed to the Japanese foreign ministry said#e185 Saudi Arabia told#e186 U.S., European and#55#0 Japanese oil companies of a 15-20 percent cutback#e279 in its oil supply in September#t303. Meanwhile#3#Expansion, Egypt's official Middle East News Agency said#e188 Thursday#t304 that Saddam was the target#e189 of an assassination attempt#e280, which led#e190 to `` large-scale ''arrests#e282, including some close associates of the Iraqi strongman. The agency quoted#e192 witnesses as#71#0 saying#e193 tanks and#56#0 armored cars are patrolling#e283 the streets of Baghdad. There was no independent confirmation#e194 of the report by the government-run news agency, which did not say#e195 when#16#0 the reported attempt#e286 occurred#e198.
