ea980120.1830.0071 We are here#e116 this#t53>week#t53 to witness#e61 the rendezvous#e62 that Fidel Castro and#5#0 the Pope are having with history. We are here#e117 because#0#0 what happens#e3 on this island will also#2#Expansion have an impact#e4 on the United States. Everything that happens in Cuba gets America's attention. Incidentally, we just show up to do the broadcast#e65, and#6#0 Cubans want#e8 to know#e9 what we're going to tell#e11 Americans, in many cases, what their relatives in the United States are going to hear#e15. Well, this is the eve of the Pope's visit#e66 to one of the last bastions of Communism anywhere in the world, and#7#0 it is already causing#e16 enormous expectations. In Revolution Square, they put#e17 up a giant cross today#t59. And#8#Expansion right across from the Cuban revolutionary icon Che Guevara, they now#t56 have a giant portrait of Jesus. Above it in Spanish, Jesus, in you we believe#e3000. Not all Cubans believe, but#12#0 Castro has invited#e23 everyone to welcome#e24 the man who has been one of Communism's most effective adversaries, and#9#0 that's why there is suspense. Everyone appears#e25 to believe#e26 that somehow Cuba is going to change#e28. Castro has said#e29 officially that it's okay to be enthusiastic#e3001. And#10#Expansion so#16#0, people are increasingly enthusiastic by today#t68, Cuban television, which clings to the Communist Party line, actually began#e31 to promote#e32 its papal coverage#e70. Today#t57, hundreds of people from the US began#e33 to arrive#e34, including some Cuban Americans who left#e36 here when#4#0 Castro came#e38 to power and#11#0 are returning#e40 to Havana for#15#0 the first time. The Pope's visit#e72 is important, but#13#0 they are also#3#Expansion coming#e41 home. This is quite an extraordinary story#e42 unfolding#e43 here. We ll come#e44 back to Havana later#1#0 in the broadcast#e46. But#14#0 now#t58 we're going to go#e49 back to New York, where Diane Sawyer has the rest of the news. Diane?
