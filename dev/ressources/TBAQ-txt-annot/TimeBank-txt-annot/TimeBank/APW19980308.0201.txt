ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP)_ Some 1,500 ethnic Albanians marched#e2 Sunday#t68 in downtown Istanbul, burning#e62 Serbian flags to protest#e47 the killings#e75 of ethnic Albanians by Serb police in southern Serb Kosovo province. The police barred#e76 the crowd from reaching#e49 the Yugoslavian consulate in downtown Istanbul, but allowed#e77 them to demonstrate#e13 on nearby streets. ``Stop#e14 the bloodshed#e50 in Kosovo,'' the protesters chanted#e116. Meanwhile in the capital, Ankara, a few hundred ethnic Albanians laid#e18 a black wreath at the gate of Yugoslavian embassy. Ethnic Albanians comprise 90 percent of the population in Kosovo, but Serbs maintain control through a large military and police presence. Serbian police say#e22 they are trying#e23 to eliminate#e25 the pro-independence Kosovo Liberation Army and restore#e27 order. At least 51 people were reported#e29 killed#e30 in clashes#e31 between Serb police and ethnic Albanians in the troubled region in recent#t71>days#t71. Turkey, worried#e34 about civil war in Kosovo spilling#e72 to the whole Balkans, urged#e36 all Balkan states to sign#e38 a joint declaration that the Kosovo crisis be solved#e40 peacefully and without any change#e41 of borders. Turks feel they have special ties to the whole region, which they ruled for hundreds of years during the Ottoman Empire. They also share Islam with the ethnic Albanians.
