German far-right party fined for violating donor laws


BONN, Germany (AP)_ A phony address listed on disclosure forms for a French donor will cost#e3 the far-right German People's Union about 549,000 marks (dlrs 305,000), parliament said#e5 Friday#t40. Parliamentary president Rita Suessmuth said#e6 the People's Union correctly listed#e7 Jacques de Mathan as having donated#e8 about 274,500 marks in 1995#t41, but gave#e9 a false address for him. German law requires#e10 parties to publish#e11 the name and address of anyone who donates#e12 more than 20,000 marks (dlrs 11,000). The anti-foreigner party said#e14 it wanted#e15 to protect#e16 the donor from possible attacks#e17. Suessmuth said#e36, however, that the law does not allow#e20 for providing#e22 a false address for any reason. The fine is twice the donation, as provided for under German party financing laws. Party spokesman Bernd Droese said#e25 the People's Union would challenge#e26 the fine in court. The extremist party recently#t42 took#e28 a surprising 13 percent of the vote in elections#e29 in a depressed eastern German state, and hopes#e32 to win#e33 its first seats in the federal parliament this#t43>September#t43.
