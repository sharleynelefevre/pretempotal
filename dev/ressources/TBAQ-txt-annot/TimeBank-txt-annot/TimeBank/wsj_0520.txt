Dutch Firm Seeks @ To Buy Up to 25% @ Of Nashua's Stock @ ---- @ By Lawrence Ingrassia @ Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal 10/30/89 WALL STREET JOURNAL (J) NSH TENDER OFFERS, MERGERS, ACQUISITIONS (TNM) BUYBACKS, REDEMPTIONS, SWAP OFFERS (BBK) NASHUA, N.H.


Nashua Corp., rumored#e1 a potential takeover target for six#t77>months#t77, said#e3 that a Dutch company has sought#e4 U.S. approval#e5 to buy#e7 up to 25% of Nashua's shares.

Nashua immediately responded#e8 by strengthening#e9 a poison-pill plan and saying#e10 it will buy#e11 back up to one million of its shares, or 10.4% of the 9.6 million outstanding.

Nashua, whose major business is selling copiers, facsimile machines and related supplies, said#e15 Reiss amp Co. B.V. of the Netherlands filed#e16 a request with the Federal Trade Commission under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act for permission to buy#e20 more than $15 million of Nashua's stock but less than 25%.

Previously, an affiliate of Unicorp Canada disclosed#e21 a stake of less than 5% in Nashua, according#e80 to Daniel M. Junius, Nashua's treasurer.

Nashua's stock has fluctuated#e23 sharply on takeover speculation, rising#e26 to a high for the#t88>year#t88 of $42.875 a share in June#t89 from $29.75 in March#t90.

But the company has had#e91 weak results so far this#t92>year#t92, with earnings declining#e28 43% to $13.7 million, or $1.43 a share, on a 4% decline in revenue to $713.5 million through the#t100>first#t100>nine#t100>months#t100 of the#t1000>year#t1000.

Its stock has slumped#e30 recently#t101, closing#e31 unchanged Friday#t103 at $29 a share in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange; at that price, the company has a market value of about $278.4 million. Nashua announced#e35 the Reiss request#e104 after the market closed#e38.

Mr. Junius said#e39 Nashua's "intention is to remain#e41 an independent public company." The company said#e42 it amended#e43 its shareholder rights plan by reducing#e45 to 10% from 20% the level of ownership by an outsider that would trigger the issuance to other holders of rights to buy additional shares of Nashua common at half price.

In addition, the company's board authorized#e53 the purchase#e54 of up to an additional one million shares. Under a program approved#e56 by the company in 1987#t109 that didn't specify a share amount, Nashua had purchased#e59 481,000 shares through Sept.#t111>29#t111.

Alex Henderson, an analyst at Prudential-Bache Securities, said#e60 that while Nashua's performance this#t112>year#t112 has been "atrocious," the company nonetheless is attractive as a "classic breakup candidate because there's no similarity between its {four} businesses." He estimated#e65 the breakup value at $55 a share. In addition to selling Japanese-made photocopiers and facsimile machines in Europe and copier supplies in the U.S., Nashua has three other major businesses: labels and tapes, data storage disks for computers and mail-order photofinishing.
