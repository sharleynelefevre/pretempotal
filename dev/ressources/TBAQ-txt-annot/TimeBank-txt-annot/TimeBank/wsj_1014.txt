Anheuser-Busch, Slugging It Out, Plans Beer Price Cuts @ ---- @ By James P. Miller @ Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal 10/26/89 WALL STREET JOURNAL (J) BUD BEVERAGES (BVG) MARKETING, ADVERTISING (MKT) EARNINGS (ERN)


Anheuser-Busch Cos. said#e1 it plans#e2 to aggressively discount#e4 its major beer brands, setting#e5 the stage for a potentially bruising price war#e6 as the maturing industry's growth#e192 continues#e8 to slow#e10.

Anheuser, the world's largest brewer and U.S. market leader, has historically been reluctant#e203 to engage#e12 in price-cutting#e210 as a means of boosting#e14 sales volume. With the passing#e15 of the heady days#t227 of swelling industry sales, however, the once-sporadic and brief forays#e17 into discounting#e18 are becoming#e20 standard competitive weapons in the beer industry.

Over the summer#t246, Anheuser competitors offered#e24 more and deeper discounts#e25 than industry observers have seen#e26 for a long time. Some experts now#t261 predict#e28 Anheuser's entry#e29 into the fray means#e32 near-term earnings trouble#e33 for all the industry players.

The St. Louis company said#e34 major rivals, Philip Morris Co.'s Miller Brewing unit and Adolph Coors Co. "have been following#e35 a policy of continuous and deep discounting#e36 for at#t283>least#t283>the#t283>past#t283>18#t283>months#t283" on their premium brands, pricing#e38 their product as much as 25 cents a 12-pack below Anheuser's Budweiser label in many markets. Anheuser said#e42 it's discounting policy basically would involve#e43 matching#e45 such moves#e46 by rivals on a market-by-market basis.

Anheuser-Busch announced#e47 its plan#e1991 at the same time it reported#e50 third-quarter#t321 net income rose#e51 a lower-than-anticipated 5.2% to $238.3 million, or 83 cents a share, from $226.5 million, or 78 cents. Third-period sales were $2.49 billion, up from last year's $2.34 billion.

Anheuser said#e52 its new strategy -- started#e53 in some markets last#t354>month#t354 and expected#e56 to be applied#e58 soon in selected markets nationwide -- will mean#e61 lower-than-anticipated earnings for the#t371>last#t371>half#t371>of#t371>1989#t371 and for 1990#t370. The projection#e62 sent#e63 Anheuser shares plunging#e64 $4.375 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday#t394. The stock closed#e65 at $38.50 on heavy volume of about 3.5 million shares. Shares of Coors, the company's sole publicly traded major competitor, fell#e66 $1.50 apiece to $19.125 in national over-the-counter trading, apparently on investor concerns over potential fallout#e410 from the coming pricing struggle#e70.

Anheuser noted#e72 that "beer industry sales volume is 1989#t419 is following#e73 the trend that has characterized#e74 the#t446>last#t446>half#t446>of#t446>the#t446>'80s#t446, with sales volume being essentially flat#e2238" while consolidation#e77 creates#e78 fewer, bigger players.

"We cannot permit#e80 a further slowing#e2000 in our volume trend," Anheuser said#e82, adding#e83 it will take#e84 "appropriate competitive pricing actions#e85 to support#e87 our long-term market share growth strategy" for the premium brands. Anheuser said#e88 it continues#e89 to hold#e91 to its earlier-announced#e2045 goal of a 50% U.S. market share by the#t2054>mid-1990s#t2054.

Beneath the tepid news-release jargon lies#e94 a powerful threat from the brewing giant, which last year accounted#e96 for about 41% of all U.S. beer sales and is expected#e97 to see#e99 that grow#e100 to 42.5% in the#t2056>current#t2056>year#t2056. "Anheuser is the biggest guy in the bar, and he just decided#e102 to join#e104 in the barroom brawl#e105," said#e107 Joseph J. Doyle, an analyst with Smith Barney, Harris Upham amp Co. "It's going to get#e110 bloody."

Jerry Steinman, publisher of Beer Marketers Insights, a trade newsletter, said#e112 Anheuser's announcement#e113 means#e114 "everybody else in the industry is going to have#e2125 a difficult time reaching#e120 their profit objectives."

Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. analyst George E. Thompson downplayed#e121 the importance of the announcement#e122, and called#e123 any comparison between the coming beer-industry tiff and the seemingly unending "cola wars," unwarranted. Mr. Thompson calls#e128 discounting "a loser's game for anyone without a dominant market share," and projected#e131 that Anheuser's statement of intent could simply be a means of warning#e2164 competitors to ease#e137 up on price-cutting#e2175 or face a costly and fruitless battle#e138.

Mr. Thompson noted#e139 that the disappointing earnings, which fell#e140 five cents a share short of his own projections#e141, contributed#e142 to the sell-off by an edgy and currently unforgiving investing public.

But Smith Barney's Mr. Doyle, who yesterday#t2196 trimmed#e144 his 1990#t2201 Anheuser earnings projection to $2.95 a share from $3.10, called#e145 the market's reaction "justified." While the third-quarter#t2210 earnings were a "moderate disappointment," he said#e149, "the real bad news is the intensity#e2239 of price competition#e151" in the premium-beer sector.

According#e2231 to Mr. Steinman, the newsletter publisher, Anheuser's market share is nearly twice that of its nearest competitor, Miller Brewing, which had#e2237 a 21.2% stake last#t2238>year#t2238. It's followed#e154 by Stroh Brewery Co., which has agreed#e155 to sell#e157 its assets to Coors. Both Coors and Stroh have recently been ceding#e158 market share to Miller and Anheuser.
