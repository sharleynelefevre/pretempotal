First and only Hungarian astronaut moving to the United States


BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP)_ Tired of being sidelined, Hungarian astronaut Bertalan Farkas is leaving#e2 for the United States to start#e3 a new career, he said#e4 Saturday#t31. ``Being 48 is too early to be retired,'' a fit-looking Farkas said#e7 on state TV's morning talk show. With American astronaut Jon McBride, Farkas set#e8 up an American-Hungarian joint venture called Orion 1980, manufacturing space-travel related technology. Farkas will move#e11 to the company's U.S. headquarters. Farkas, an air force captain, was sent#e12 into space on board the Soyuz 36 on May#t33>26,#t33>1980#t33. He spent#e14 six#t34>days#t34 aboard the Salyut 6 spacecraft with three Soviet astronauts, Valery Kubasov, Leonid Popov and Valery Riumin. McBride, 54, of Lewisburg, West Virginia, was part#e2000 of a seven-member crew aboard the Orbiter Challenger in October#t35>1984#t35 and later served#e15 as assistant administrator for congressional relations for NASA. Farkas expressed#e16 the hope he one day follow#e17 in the footsteps of fellow astronaut John Glenn, who at 77 is about to go#e21 into space again. On May#t37>22,#t37>1995#t37, Farkas was made#e22 a brigadier general, and the#t38>following#t38>year#t38 he was appointed#e23 military attache at the Hungarian embassy in Washington. However, cited#e24 by District of Columbia traffic police in December#t39 for driving#e25 under the influence of alcohol, Farkas was ordered#e26 home and retired#e27. (ab/dc)
