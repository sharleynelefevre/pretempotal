Technology amp Health: @ Compaq Computer @ Posts a 51% Surge @ In 3rd-Period Net @ ---- @ By Robert Tomsho @ Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal 10/26/89 WALL STREET JOURNAL (J) CPQ COMPUTERS AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (CPR) EARNINGS (ERN) HOUSTON


Compaq Computer Corp. said#e1 that its net income rose#e2 51% in the#t106>third#t106>quarter#t106, bolstered#e3 by unusual gains#e117 from its investment#e4 in a disk-drive maker and reflecting continued growth#e52 in its European operations.

The computer maker said#e9 net jumped#e10 to $87 million, or $2.02 a share, from $58 million, or $1.40 a share, a#t58>year#t58>earlier#t58. Sales increased#e12 36% to $683 million from $502 million. The#t64>latest#t64>quarter#t64's results#e13, however, included a pretax gain#e66 of $13.7 million, or 20 cents a share, in the carrying value of the company's investment#e16 in Conner Peripherals Inc. and a $7.6 million gain, or 11 cents a share, from the sale#e17 of one million Conner shares.

Net for the#t68>nine#t68>months#t68 was $254 million, or $5.94 a share, up 56% from $163 million, or $4.06 a share, a#t72>year#t72>earlier#t72. Sales rose#e20 50% to $2.1 billion from $1.4 billion. Net for the#t247>year-earlier#t247>nine#t247>months#t247 also included a gain#e80 of $9.7 million, or 15 cents a share, in the carrying value of the Conner investment#e81.

Michael Swavely, president of Compaq's North America division, attributed#e23 the company's third-quarter#t82 performance#e24 to continued increases#e25 in international sales, which accounted for 43% of the company's sales, a 74% increase#e28 from a#t83>year#t83>earlier#t83.

"Over the#t86>next#t86>couple#t86>of#t86>years#t86 we would not be surprised#e29 to see#e33 Europe and international {sales} represent#e34 50% of the company's revenues," he said#e35.

During the#t87>third#t87>quarter#t87, Compaq purchased#e36 a former Wang Laboratories manufacturing facility in Stirling, Scotland, which will be used#e37 for international service and repair operations. Mr. Swavely said#e40 the new space will allow#e41 Compaq to increase#e43 the manufacturing capacity of its plant in Erskine, Scotland.

In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday#t91, Compaq shares fell#e44 $1.625 to $108.625.
