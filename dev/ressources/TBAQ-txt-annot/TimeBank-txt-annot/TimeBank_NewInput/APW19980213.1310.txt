APW19980213.1310 Prime Minister John Howard, a monarchist himself, promised#e5 to put#e7 the question to a national referendum#e9 next#t112>year#t112 after#s1 convention delegates voted#e10 89-52 for a republic, with 11 abstentions. Spontaneous applause#e11 echoed#e12 through the chamber and public galleries as the crucial vote#e13 passed#e14 by a wide margin.`` I want#e15 a referendum#e16, ''Howard said#e17.`` The Australian people are owed#e18 the opportunity of expressing#e19 an opinion on this. ''`` It would be a travesty#e21 in common sense terms of Australian democracy for that proposition not to be put#e24 to the Australian people, ''Howard said#e25. Even in his own Cabinet, Howard is becoming#e26 increasingly isolated#e27 with his monarchist stance. Treasurer Peter Costello, Environment Minister Robert Hill and Attorney General Daryl Williams all voted#e28 to support#e30 the republic Friday#t114.`` This convention will be seen#e31 as a turning point in our history, ''Australian Republican Movement spokeswoman Mary Delahunty said#e32. Pro-republicans hope#e33 to have#e35 an Australian president by the opening#e36 of the 2000#t121 Olympics and the 100th anniversary of Australian federation. Calling#e37 for an amended constitution with a new preamble, to be written#e41 by Australian poets, republican Janet Holmes a Court said#e115, `` We need#e42 the smell of eucalyptus in this, and the feel of red dust. ''Monarchists hope#e43 to defeat#e45 the republic at the referendum#e46.`` The phony war#e48 has finished#e49 and the real referendum campaign#e50 has clearly begun#e51, ''Australians for a Constitutional Monarchy executive director Kerry Jones said#e52.`` Well may we say#e53 ` God save#e3000 the Queen, ''for nothing will save the republic, ''outraged monarchist delegate David Mitchell said#e58.`` The idea of a republic will fall#e319 to dust through the grace of almighty God. ''Polls have shown#e62 public support for a republic increasing#e64, rising#e65 from about 35 percent several#t117>years#t117>ago#t117 to about 51 percent this#t358>year#t358, as pro-monarchist sentiment diminishes#e66. Australia has been independent#e374 since#s2 1901#t118, but like many Commonwealth nations it still recognizes#e67 the British monarch as its head of state. Howard said#e68 Queen Elizabeth II is taking#e69 a great interest in the convention#e387.`` She is, I can assure#e70 you, from what I ve been told#e72, she's following#e73 the thing very closely and taking#e75 the view it's our business.`` It's no secret that she's indicated#e78 to me.. she is a 20th#t1000>century#t1000 democrat, understands#e79 that the role of the crown in Australia rests#e82 in the hands of the Australian people as it has#e85 for#s3 almost#t119>a#t119>hundred#t119>years#t119. ''The model for a republic, adopted#e86 over bitter objections#e87 from those advocating#e88 direct election of a president, is for presidential nominations to be made with public input and the winning candidate decided by a two-thirds majority of Parliament. Former prime minister Paul Keating, who put#e95 the republic issue in the spotlight in his unsuccessful 1996#t120 campaign#e97 for re-election, welcomed#e98 the result#e99.`` This is an important step along the path towards Australia claiming its full sovereignty, and due recognition that the monarchy can no longer serve us appropriately, ''Keating said.
