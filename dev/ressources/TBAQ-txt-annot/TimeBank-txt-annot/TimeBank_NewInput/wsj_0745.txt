wsj_0745 GM Seeks to Buy Up to 15 % of Jaguar, X X @ Heating Up Its Skirmishing With Ford X @-- X @ By Joann S. Lublin X X X @ Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal 10/27/89 WALL STREET JOURNAL (J) GM JAGRY F EUROP TENDER OFFERS, MERGERS, ACQUISITIONS (TNM) AUTOMOBILES (AUT) LONDON GM sought#e8 U.S. antitrust clearance#e159 last#t158>week#t158 to purchase#e10 more than $ 15 million worth of Jaguar shares but doesn't own#e11 any yet#t161, according#e149 to GM officials here and at the company's Detroit headquarters. The No. 1 U.S. auto maker then wrote#e13 Jaguar that it intends#e14 `` to go#e16 to that 15 % ''level once it wins#e17 the U.S. clearance#e152 to go#e19 beyond $ 15 million, a Jaguar spokesman said#e20 yesterday#t163. The GM move#e154 follows Tuesday#t164's declaration#e22 by Ford, which holds an unwelcome 12.45 % stake in Jaguar, that it is prepared#e25 to bid#e27 for the entire company. GM is close to completing#e29 a friendly deal#e30 with Jaguar that is likely to involve#e2073 an eventual 30 % stake and joint manufacturing ventures. Speculative investors, betting#e35 on an imminent clash#e36 between Ford and GM, pushed#e38 up Jaguar's share price five pence (eight U.S. cents) to a near-record 720 pence ( $ 11.60) in late trading#e39 on London's stock exchange yesterday#t313. Since#s1 Tuesday#t314, the shares have gained#e42 nearly 4 %. But an all-out bidding war#e2091 between the world's top auto giants for Britain's leading luxury-car maker seems unlikely.`` We will not go#e46 over a certain level, ''said#e48 David N. McCammon, Ford's vice president for finance, at a news conference#e316 yesterday#t315 in Dearborn, Mich. `` There's some price at which we'd stop#e50 bidding#e52. ''He wouldn't specify#e53 what it was. And powerful political pressures#e318 may convince#e56 the Conservative government to keep#e59 its so-called golden share, which limits any individual holding to 15 %, until#s2 the restriction expires#e63 on#s3 Dec.#t325>31,#t325>1990#t325.`` I really don't see#e64 the government doing#e66 something that Jaguar doesn't want#e67 over#s4 the#t327>next#t327>14#t327>months#t327, ''said#e69 Kenneth Warren, a Conservative member of Parliament and chairman of the Select Committee on Trade and Industry in Britain's House of Commons.`` The golden share is a single share, but it is the magic share. ''The government retained#e70 the single share after#s5 selling#e72 its stake in Jaguar in#s6 1984#t330-- part of a nationalistic practice of protecting former government-owned enterprises to deflect criticism of privatization. The 15 % restriction covers any would-be suitor, UCP British or foreign. Ford is willing#e1988 to bid#e82 for 100 % of Jaguar's shares if both the government and Jaguar shareholders agree#e84 to relax#e86 the anti-takeover barrier prematurely. As Jaguar's biggest holder and Britain's biggest car maker, Ford could turn#e87 up the heat by convening#e89 a special shareholders meeting#e90 and urging#e91 holders to drop#e1985 the limits early. Ford might succeed#e92 because many shareholders are speculators keen#e1986 for a full bid#e94 or institutional investors unhappy#e1987 over Jaguar management's handling#e95 of its current#t1992 financial difficulties#e1994. The government probably wouldn't give#e97 in readily to a hostile foray by Ford, however. It has relinquished#e101 a golden share only once before-- during British Petroleum Co. s #2.5 billion ( $ 4 billion) takeover#e103 of Britoil PLC in#s7 1988#t1998. In wooing#e104 British lawmakers, GM has pointed#e105 out that its willingness to settle#e107 for a minority stake would keep#e109 Jaguar British-owned#e2000 and independent#e2001. This#t2007>week#t2007, the U.S. auto giant paid#e111 for 10 NAC House of Commons members and two NAC House of Lords members to fly#e113 to Detroit and tour#e114 its operations there. While the visit#e116 was unrelated to Jaguar, GM Chairman Roger Smith answered#e117 the legislators questions#e118 about it over lunch#e2385 Tuesday#t2386. He said#e119 Jaguar `` shouldn't be smothered#e120 by anyone else, ''recalled#e123 one participant. Politics also influences the government's thinking on the anti-takeover restriction. The Conservatives don't dare jeopardize marginal Tory seats in Coventry, where Jaguar has headquarters, nor can the government easily back down on promised protection for a privatized company while it proceeds with controversial plans to privatize most of Britain's water and electricity industries. Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher might, however, be receptive#e2011 to any request#e138 by Jaguar Chairman Sir John Egan for the restriction's early removal#e139 to let GM amass#e142 more than 15 % or mount#e143 a friendly suitor bid#e2012 against Ford. In the end, Sir John-- rather than the government or Jaguar shareholders-- may hold the key that unlocks the golden share.
