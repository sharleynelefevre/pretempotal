Bethlehem Steel @ Net Fell 54 % X @ In 3rd Period X @-- @ Higher Costs, Less Volume @ Are Cited; 2 Others Post @ Lower Operating Profits @-- X @ By Clare Ansberry @ Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal 10/26/89 WALL STREET JOURNAL (J) BS AS NII STEEL MANUFACTURERS (STL) EARNINGS (ERN) Bethlehem Steel Corp., hammered#e1 by higher costs and lower shipments to key automotive and service-center customers, posted#e5 a 54 % drop in#s1 third-quarter#t180 profit. Separately, two more of the nation's top steelmakers-- Armco Inc. and National Intergroup Inc.-- reported#e7 lower operating earnings in their steel businesses, marking#e10 what is generally believed#e11 to be the end of a two-year#t283 boom#e13 in the industry. Wall Street analysts expect#e16 the disappointing trend#e310 to continue#e18 into the#t182>fourth#t182>quarter#t182 and through at least the first#t183>two#t183>quarters#t183>of#t183>1990#t183, when the industry will increasingly see#e21 the effect of price erosion#e185 in major product lines, such as rolled sheet used for cars, appliances and construction.`` It doesn't bode#e26 well for#s2 coming#t190>quarters#t190, ''said#e29 John Jacobson, who follows the steel industry for AUS Consultants. In fact, he thinks#e33 several steelmakers will report#e34 actual losses#e191 through the#t192>third#t192>quarter#t192>of#t192>1990#t192. Bethlehem, the nation's second largest steelmaker, earned#e35 $ 46.9 million, or 54 cents a share. The figures include#e373 $ 15 million in costs related to a blast furnace outage#e375 and $ 8 million in losses from unauthorized work outages#e377 at the company's coal operations. In the year-ago#t196>period#t196, Bethlehem earned#e44 $ 101.4 million, or $ 1.27 a share, including a $ 3.8 million gain#e197 from early retirement of debt. Third-quarter#t198 sales dropped#e47 11 % to $ 1.27 billion from $ 1.43 billion a#t199>year#t199>ago#t199. In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Bethlehem shares rose#e49 50 cents to $ 17.375. Of all the major steelmakers, Bethlehem would seem#e50 to be the most vulnerable#e201 to a slowdown#e53. It hasn't diversified#e490 beyond steel, nor has it linked#e56 up with a joint venture partner to share#e59 costs and risks. However, in spite of the difficult industrywide environment of high cost and low volume, Bethlehem `` had#e206 pretty good earnings numbers, ''said#e63 Michelle Galanter Applebaum, an analyst with Salomon Brothers Inc. Ms. Applebaum had estimated#e64 third-quarter#t207 earnings of 55 cents a shhha55 cents a share, ents a share, but ssa share, but said#e67 the losses for the unusual items were larger#e548 than expected#e68. Still, Bethlehem's core basic steel operations experienced#e70 a steep drop#e210 in operating profit to $ 58.6 million from $ 186.4 million a#t211>year#t211>ago#t211, when#s3 the industry enjoyed#e74 strong demand and pricing. The company said#e76 its shipments declined#e78 as a result of a reduction#e80 in inventories by service centers, a lackluster automotive market and increasing#e84 competitive pressures in the construction market. At the same time, production costs, compared with a#t215>year#t215>ago#t215, were boosted#e89 by higher raw material and employment costs, which resulted#e91 from the company's new labor pact#e92 effective June#t219>1#t219.`` We anticipate#e93 that steel market conditions will exhibit#e94 a further moderate decline#e222 in#s4 the#t220>fourth#t220>quarter#t220 as the automotive sector remains#e95 weak and customers continue#e96 to adjust#e98 inventories, ''said#e100 Bethlehem Chairman Walter F. Williams. He noted#e223, however, that the company's order entry has increased#e104 from the low levels of the#t224>early#t224>summer#t224, following#e106 the end of labor negotiations#e107. Steel business, said#e109 third-quarter#t225 net income dropped#e110 8 % to $ 33 million, or 35 cents a share, from $ 36 million, or 39 cents a share in#s5 the#t227>year-ago#t227>quarter#t227. Sales dropped#e112 to $ 441.1 million from $ 820.4 million, because the company no longer consolidates#e114 its Eastern Steel division, which is now#t730 a joint venture#e115 with Kawasaki Steel Corp. Along with reduced volume, analysts said#e116 the nation's fifth largest steelmaker was hurt#e117 by holding#e118 higher-cost inventory when raw material costs of such key products as nickel dropped#e122. Operating profit dropped#e123 46 % in its specialty flat-rolled steel segment. Moreover, the company said#e125 higher sales and shipments to service centers from its Armco Steel Co. joint venture failed#e129 to offset#e231 weakness in the automotive market, higher production costs and a poorer product mix. Armco shares closed#e133 unchanged at $ 10.625 in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange. National Intergroup, which owns#e136 50 % of the nation's sixth largest steelmaker-- National Steel Corp.-- posted#e137 net income for the fiscal#t234>second-quarter#t234 of $ 8.6 million, or 33 cents a share, compared with a net loss of $ 50.3 million. Sales increased#e141 in the quarter#t236 ended#e142 Sept.#t235>30#t235 to $ 747.8 million from $ 623.5 million a#t239>year#t239>ago#t239. The#t240>latest#t240>period#t240 includes#e143 gains of $ 9.1 million from early retirement of debt and tax loss carry-forward. Last#t838>year#t838's results were hurt#e148 by $ 41.3 million in restructuring charges. National Intergroup stock closed#e151 at $ 15, unchanged in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange. The company noted#e154 that its NX NX Fox-Meyer Drug Co., NX Ben Franklin Stores Inc. and NX Permian Corp. operations showed#e155 improvements#e156 as a result of restructuring moves#e158. However, its equity in the net income of National Steel declined#e159 to $ 6.3 million from $ 10.9 million as a result of softer demand and lost orders following prolonged labor talks#e164 and a threatened#e249 strike#e165. National Intergroup is negotiating#e166 for the sale#e167 of its 50 % interest in National Steel to concentrate#e250 more fully on drug distribution operations.
