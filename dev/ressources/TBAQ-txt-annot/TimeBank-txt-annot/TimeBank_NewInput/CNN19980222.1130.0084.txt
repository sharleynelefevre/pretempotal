A UN spokesman says#e5 UN secretary general Kofi Annan is on the verge of a breakthrough, but added#e6 it's not done#e7 yet. Annan wrapped#e8 up a three#t122>hour#t122 meeting#e35 with Iraqi president Saddam Hussein in Baghdad today#t18. He's expected#e9 to meet#e73 with Iraqi deputy prime minister Tariq Aziz later#t64>this#t64>afternoon#t64. One major sticking point has been Iraq's proposal#e129 to open#e46 it's presidential sites for#s1 no#t70>more#t70>than#t70>sixty#t70>days#t70.
