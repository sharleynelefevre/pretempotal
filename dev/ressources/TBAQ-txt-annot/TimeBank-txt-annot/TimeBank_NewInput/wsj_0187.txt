International: X @ Finland, Big Creditors X @ To Set Up Company @ To Complete Ships 11/02/89 WALL STREET JOURNAL (J) EUROP CCL BANKRUPTCIES (BCY) TRANSPORTATION, TRUCK AND SHIP LINES, RAILROADS (TRA) STOCKHOLM The Finnish government and major creditors of bankrupt shipyard Waertsilae Marine Industries Oy agreed#e1 in principle to form#e2 a new company to complete#e3 most of the troubled shipyard's backlog of 15 ships. The new company will attempt#e4 to limit#e5 the shipyard's losses, participants said#e6.`` The situation is that the bankruptcy court will get#e7 out of the shipbuilding business. Everything will be taken over by the new company, ''said#e9 Christian Andersson, executive vice president of Oy Waertsilae, former parent of Waertsilae Marine. Once its ownership is finalized#e10, the new company will open#e40 talks#e41 with state-appointed receivers to buy#e12 or lease#e43 Waertsilae Marine's shipyard facilities. Subcontractors will be offered#e13 a settlement#e44 and a swift transition#e45 to new management is expected#e14 to avert#e15 an exodus#e46 of skilled workers from Waertsilae Marine's two big shipyards, government officials said#e16. Under an accord signed#e17 yesterday#t35, the government and Union Bank of Finland would become#e18 major shareholders in the new company, each injecting#e20 100 million Finnish markkaa ( $ 23.5 million). Oy Waertsilae is to contribute#e21 200 million markkaa, most of it as subordinated debt, and take#e22 a minority stake in the new company. Customers holding#e23 contracts for Waertsilae Marine's undelivered ships are expected#e24 to subscribe#e25 most of the remaining 170 million markkaa in share capital, government officials said#e27. Waertsilae Marine's biggest creditor is Miami-based Carnival Cruise Lines Inc. Carnival, which has#e28 three ships on order from Waertsilae Marine, presented#e232 claims for $ 1.5 billion damages in the bankruptcy court this#t37>week#t37. Waertsilae Marine's bankruptcy proceedings#e50 began#e32 Tuesday#t36 in a Helsinki court.
