Aetna Life amp Casualty @ Profit Decreased 22 % X @ In the Third Quarter 10/30/89 WALL STREET JOURNAL (J) AET EARNINGS (ERN) INSURANCE (INS) HARTFORD, NAC Conn. Aetna Life amp Casualty Co.'s third-quarter#t44 net income fell#e1 22 % to $ 182.6 million, or $ 1.63 a share, reflecting the damages#e47 from Hurricane Hugo and lower results#e3 for some of the company's major divisions. Catastrophe losses#e48 reduced#e4 Aetna's net income by $ 50 million, including $ 36 million from Hugo. Last#t49>year#t49 catastrophe losses#e50 totaled $ 5 million, when#s1 net#e7 was $ 235.5 million, or $ 2.07 a share. The year-earlier#t52 results#e8 have been restated#e9 to reflect#e11 an accounting change#e12. The insurer has started#e13 processing#e54 claims#e14 from the Northern California earthquake#e55 nearly#t57>two#t57>weeks#t57>ago#t57. But because these claims are more difficult to evaluate and have been coming#e18 in more slowly, the company has#e19 no estimate#e20 of the impact#e21 of the earthquake#e60 on#s2 fourth-quarter#t61 results#e22. In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday#t63, Aetna closed#e24 at $ 60, down 50 cents. In#s3 the#t65>latest#t65>quarter#t65, Aetna had#e67 a $ 23 million loss#e25 on its auto/homeowners line, compared with earnings#e68 of $ 33 million last#t69>year#t69. Profit for its commercial insurance division fell#e28 30 % to $ 59 million, reflecting higher catastrophe losses#e70 and the price war#e71 in the property/casualty market for#s4 nearly#t73>three#t73>years#t73. However, Aetna's employee benefits division, which includes its group health insurance operations, posted#e34 a 34 % profit gain#e74 to $ 106 million. Third-quarter#t75 results#e35 included net realized capital gains#e76 of $ 48 million, which included#e89 $ 27 million from the sale#e39 of Federated Investors in#s5 August#t80 and a $ 15 million tax credit. In#s6 the#t81>nine#t81>months#t81, net rose#e42 4.3 % to $ 525.8 million or $ 4.67 a share, from $ 504.2 million, or $ 4.41 a share, last#t85>year#t85.
