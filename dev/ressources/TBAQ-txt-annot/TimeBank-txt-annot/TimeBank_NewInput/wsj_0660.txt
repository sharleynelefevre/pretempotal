International Brief-- Erbamont N.V.: @ Montedison Agrees to Buy @ Rest of Stock for $ 37 Each 10/30/89 WALL STREET JOURNAL (J) MNT ERB TENDER OFFERS, MERGERS, ACQUISITIONS (TNM) Montedison S.p.A. definitively agreed#e1 to buy#e3 all of the publicly held shares of Erbamont N.V. for $ 37 each. Montedison now#t29 owns#e4 about 72 % of Erbamont's shares outstanding. The companies said#e5 the accord was unanimously approved#e6 by a special committee of Erbamont directors unaffiliated with Montedison. Under the pact, Montedision will make#e8 a $ 37-a-share tender offer#e9 for Erbamont stock outstanding. The tender offer#e10 will be followed by the sale#e12 of all of Erbamont's assets, subject to all of its liabilities, to Montedison. Erbamont will then be liquidated#e14, with any remaining Erbamont holders receiving#e16 a distribution of $ 37 a share. The companies said#e17 the transaction is being structured#e19 this way because the laws of the Netherlands Antilles, under which Erbamont is organized, don't provide#e23 for merger transactions.
