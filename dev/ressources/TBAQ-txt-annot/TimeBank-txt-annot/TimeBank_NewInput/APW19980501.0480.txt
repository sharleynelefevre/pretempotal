MALAYSIA's aggressive move#e1 into the information age could not come#e3 in a more opportune time. With the convergence#e8 of communications and information technologies (IT) coupled with the coming#e139 of age for the Internet and its related technologies, the stage is set#e13 for Malaysians to seize#e15 the chance to transform#e17 into a knowledge society and become#e18 worthy opponents/players in the global market space. The Internet, the global network of computers, is now far reaching#e20 into the country- extending#e21 its embrace to include#e24 every nook and cranny of the nation- opening#e154 doors to not only a diverse range of information sources but also an exhaustive list of possibilities to create#e28 new applications which add#e30 value to people's lives. In the business world, the Internet- through intranet and extranet solutions- has become#e32 an invaluable tool for companies to harness so as to gain#e35 a competitive edge. The solutions are also vital components in developing#e38 the borderless marketing flagship application which is a vital element for spearheading#e40 the development#e41 of the Multimedia Super Corridor (MSC) project. The application will create#e44 the necessary framework and infrastructure to support#e46 electronic commerce (e-commerce) initiatives#e48 in the country. However, it is important to note that installing#e51 or implementing#e52 Internet technologies for technology's sake would not ensure#e55 instant success#e58. For e-commerce to flourish#e157 with full-blown end-to-end business transactions#e155, strategic planning#e156 which incorporates both business and technology plans that are complementary is necessary for an organisation to see#e159 feasible returns on investment. Intranets, through the use of Internet technology, are positioned#e142 as a platform for companies to optimise#e143, expand#e144 and transform#e145 new channels of business. When strategically implemented#e146, an intranet solution will provide#e147 the ability to mediate#e149 mission-critical, decision support functions in organisations. It will also help#e86 further improve#e150 communications and collaboration at all levels in an organisation. With intranets in place, it is only logical for organisations to respectively link#e151 the network to other companies ''for extended business purposes through extranets. While this will enable#e91 the sharing of information among enterprises, security issues such as firewalls and encryption as well as access and control procedures, and the trust levels that enterprises have with each other will emerge#e99 and there will be a need to address#e101 them. Other than usage#e102 in business, Internet technology is also beginning#e105 to infiltrate#e107 the lifestyle domain.`` Smart homes ''have emerged#e108 bringing#e109 a wealth of information and entertainment to families over telecommunications lines. The art of socialising is also experiencing#e114 a change#e115 where Net/virtual relationships are fast overtaking#e116 or becoming#e117 parallel with the normal human relationships. Whether this would prove#e118 UCP positive or otherwise towards society in#s1 the#t153>future#t153 is yet to be seen#e121. All in all, the Internet has#e122 a lot to offer#e123. However, its value and benefits are only as good as how we use#e124 it. Copyright 1998 NEW STRAITS TIMES-MANAGEMENT TIMES all rights reserved as distributed by WorldSources, Inc.
