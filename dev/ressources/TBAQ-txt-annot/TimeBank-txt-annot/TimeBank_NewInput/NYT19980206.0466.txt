NYT19980206.0466 White House on#s1 Thursday#t34 `` NX For#s2 the#t35>past#t35>few#t35>weeks#t35 we ve been subjected#e11 to false leaks designed#e57 to mislead#e13 both reporters and the American public. We're not going to dignify#e16 the latest false leak#e58 with a response#e59. ''McCurry on#s3 Friday#t37 `` I want#e17 to be absolutely clear#e60, to the extent there is any implication#e61 or the slightest suggestion#e62 that Mrs. Currie believes#e18 that the President or anyone else tried#e19 to influence#e20 her recollection, that is absolutely false and a mischaracterization#e65 of the facts. I am shocked#e21 and dismayed#e66 by the numerous leaks#e67 regarding Mrs. Currie's grand jury testimony#e69. ''Clinton on#s4 Friday#t38.`` Once again, I never asked#e23 anybody to do#e24 anything but tell#e25 the truth. I know#e26 about the stories today#t39. I was pleased#e80 that Ms. Currie's lawyers stated#e27 unambiguously this#t40>morning#t40 _ unambiguously _ that she's not aware#e81 of any unethical conduct#e83. NYT-02-06-98 2229EST
