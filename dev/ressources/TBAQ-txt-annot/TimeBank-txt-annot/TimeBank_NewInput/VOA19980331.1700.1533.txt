VOA19980331.1700.1533 19980331#t0 VOA19980331.1700.1533 NEWS STORY The US government recently announced#e1 new regulations designed#e3 to change#e5 the way transplant organs are made available to sick patients. Under the new guidelines, donor organs will be made available to the sickest people first, wherever they live in the country. Currently, transplant organs are rationed through a regional system of distribution. The private group that runs#e11 the current system, United Network for Organ Sharing, or UNOS, objects to the new regulations. UNOS says#e13 the regulations put#e15 the federal government in charge of deciding#e16 who gets#e17 transplants and that many hospital transplant centers would be forced#e19 to close#e22.UCP Health and Human Services Secretary Do- Donna Shalala says#e23 patients who need#e24 an organ transplant should not have to take#e30 a chance that an organ will become#e31 available in their local area, nor should patients have to travel#e34 to transplant centers far from their homes to improve#e38 their chances of getting#e39 an organ. UNOS spokeswoman Donna Henry Wright says#e40 the new policy would not necessarily be more fair#e121 or effective#e122 because allowances are already made#e43 for the most needy patients. The sickest patients are already treated#e44 first. There are not huge waiting uh disparit- waiting time disparities amongst the very uh sickest patients. It's between#s1 two#t3000 to six#t3001>days#t3001 for every one uh of the sickest patients across the country. um So it's a- it's a fallacy that they're doing#e48 this because um the sickest patients aren't being served#e52. Doctor James Burdick, the Professor of Transplant Surgery at Johns Hopkins University Hospital in Baltimore, Maryland, and former President of UNOS, said#e53 the current system has evolved#e54 over#s2 several#t103>years#t103 and it works#e55 well. You may, in#s3 a#t105>year#t105>or#t105>two#t105, save#e56 a few more lives if you do sickest first. But the number of patients waiting#e59 then begins#e60 to increase#e62, um and, in fact, um over#s4 the#t106>years#t106 many more patients who are about to die of liver tra- uh without a liver transplant would accumulate#e67. If you do#e68 the uh alternative extreme, you don't save#e69 as many lives in#s5 the#t118>early#t118>years#t118, by a small fraction. Our system is#e119 balanced, it's right in the middle. And, therefore, it works#e120 very well. Nationwide, there are about ten thousand patients waiting#e72 for liver transplants each#t107>year#t107 and only four thousand organs become#e74 available for transplants#e75. Secretary Shalala says#e76 UNOS five#t108>months#t108>ago#t108, or gave#e77 them five#t109>months#t109 to develop#e79 a new plan#e111 to distribute#e81 livers which are in the shortest supply.
