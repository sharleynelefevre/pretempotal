The move#e27 had been widely expected#e57 after northern Ireland police said#e6 they believe#e7 the IRA was behind#e74 two killings#e75 in Belfast last#t26>week#t26. Sinn Fein chairman Mitchell McLaughlin says#e8 the party will challenge#e9 the move#e60 by legal means if they have to. We're going to fight#e186 it. And uh we ve already challenged#e46, very strongly, the uh the terms in which this has been presented#e13. But we're challenging#e14 it on the ground that uh the RUC uh have offered#e16 an opinion, and this opinion is going to be used#e18 as a mechanism for ejecting#e19 us from the talks#e20, and uh that's a very serious. Any decision#e28 to expel#e22 Sinn Fein must be agreed#e23 jointly by the governments of both Britain and the Irish Republic.
