HERSZENHORN ampLR ampQC ampQL ampUR c. 1998 N.Y. Times News Service ampLR ampQC ampQL NEWARK, N.J. _ A new Essex County task force began#e1 delving#e45 Thursday#t46 into the slayings#e2 of 14 black women over#s1 the#t48>last#t48>five#t48>years#t48 in the Newark area, as law-enforcement officials acknowledged#e4 that they needed#e5 to work#e6 harder to solve#e7 the cases of murdered women. The police and prosecutors said#e8 they had identified#e9 different suspects in six of the cases and had yet to find#e10 any pattern linking the killings#e50 or the victims, several of whom were believed#e12 to be prostitutes.UCP State, county and local law-enforcement officials have expressed#e13 concerns in#s2 recent#t52>months#t52 about a possible pattern of murdered women and a disproportionate number of unsolved cases. Citing#e2025 an example, Sgt. Derek Glenn, a spokesman for the Newark Police Department, said#e14 that of nine women who had been killed#e15 last#t64>year#t64, suspects had been arrested#e17 in only four cases. But over all, arrests#e59 were made#e2065 in more than 60 percent of murder cases, he said#e21. Eight of the 14 killings#e2072 since#s3 1993#t63 were already under investigation#e2093 by the Newark Police Department, Glenn said#e22. Of the eight victims, three were stabbed#e23, two were strangled#e24, two were beaten#e25 to death and one was asphyxiated#e26, he said#e27, and these different methods of killing and other evidence seem#e29 to indicate#e30 that the eight cases are not related#e31. But with the task-force investigation#e66 just getting#e33 under way, officials have been careful#e2164 not to draw#e34 any firm conclusions, leaving#e35 open the possibility of a serial killer in some of the cases. There have been no arrests#e36 in any of the slayings#e65.`` I haven't seen#e38 a pattern yet, ''said#e40 Patricia Hurt, the Essex County prosecutor, who created#e41 the task force on#s4 Tuesday#t61.`` The type of lifestyle these women have#e60 is extremely dangerous, ''she said#e42.
