APW20000128.0316 2000-01-28#t0 Cubans Demand Return of Elian APW20000128.0316 NEWS STORY 2000-01-28 23:42 Cubans Demand Return of Elian By ANITA SNOW Associated Press Writer HAVANA (AP)-- Calling the mother of Elian Gonzalez `` an excellent girl, ''President Fidel Castro said#e1 Friday#t1 she had been `` practically kidnapped#e2 ''by the boyfriend who perished#e125 along with her on the boat wreck#e3 her 6-year-old son survived#e4. Castro's remarks to a conference#e77 of economists were aimed#e5 at those who say#e6 that Elian should remain in the United States because his mother sacrificed#e126 his life to take#e8 her to `` freedom, ''a vision he called#e9 a cliche. He placed#e10 the blame on Lazaro Rafael Munero, who apparently organized#e11 the ill-fated journey#e80 on which Elian's mother Elisabeth Brotons and 10 other people-- including Munero-- died#e127. Castro called#e14 Munero-- who reportedly drove#e15 a taxi and engaged#e16 in unofficial businesses in the Cuban city of Cardenas-- a `` ruffian ''on whom Cuban police had amassed#e128 `` 100 pages of reports. ''According to sources quoted#e17 by the Miami Herald, Munero had fled#e18 to Florida in#s2 June#t2>1998#t2 and returned#e19 to Cuba later#t22>that#t22>year#t22, only to be jailed#e129 for several months.`` The mother was practically kidnapped#e20 along with the boy ''to make#e21 the late-November#t19 trip#e83, Castro said#e22. The Cuban leader said#e23 Elian had been especially loved#e24 by his parents because the mother had earlier suffered#e25 seven miscarriages#e84. Earlier#s1 Friday#t4, Cuba's communist government celebrated#e26 the birth#e85 of independence hero Jose Marti on#s3 Friday#t5 with rallies#e88 calling#e27 for the return#e89 of Elian Gonzalez, the `` boy martyr ''at the center of an international custody battle#e91. Tens of thousands of children flooded#e28 Havana's Plaza of the Revolution to deliver#e29 a dual homage to Marti and Elian, the 6-year-old Cuban WP$, whose rescue#e93 off Florida's coast two#t6>months#t6>ago#t6 set#e30 off a tug-of-war between relatives living on both sides of the Florida Straits. Wearing their red Communist Pioneer neckerchiefs, a string of young boys and girls recited#e32 poems they wrote#e33 for Elian, dubbed Cuba's `` boy hero ''and `` symbolic child, ''and for Marti, commonly known on the island as Cuba's `` teacher ''and `` apostle. ''The Communist Party daily Granma compared#e35 Elian with revolutionary icon Ernesto `` Che ''Guevara and said#e36 the boy `` has been converted#e130 forever into a symbol of the crimes and injustices that imperialism is capable of committing#e37 against an innocent. ''The commemorations were similar to those held#e38 here annually#t8 for Marti, the revolutionary and poet who fought#e39 for Cuba's independence from Spain in#s4 1898#t9. But#s2 this#t10>year#t10, children wore#e40 T-shirts bearing#e103 Elian's portrait with their school uniforms. The commemorations began#e41 early Friday#t11>morning#t11, as tens of thousands of Cubans marched#e42 through Havana's streets by torchlight. Similar events#e104 were held#e43 all day in the capital and across the island. In Old Havana, hundreds of children marched#e44 around the Parque Central chanting#e105 `` We will save#e45 Elian! ''A small group of girls wore#e46 construction paper handcuffs-- an apparent reference to the government's characterization of Elian's retention in the United States as a `` kidnapping#e110. ''Fidel Castro's government has been using#e47 such traditional political events#e111-- along with other rallies#e112 almost every#t12>day#t12-- to draw#e48 attention to the case of Elian, who was rescued#e49 Nov.#t13>25#t13 while clinging#e50 to an inner tube. His mother and 10 others died#e131 at sea while trying#e51 to reach#e52 the United States. For#s3 the#t21>past#t21>two#t21>months#t21, Elian's father has demanded#e53 that the boy be returned#e54 to him in Cuba, and the U.S. government has said#e55 that father and son should be reunited#e132. But Elian's paternal great-uncle in the United States, backed#e56 by the anti-Castro Cuban American National Foundation, is fighting#e57 in the courts to keep#e58 the boy in Miami. Cuba kept#e59 up its condemnation#e114 of the handling#e115 of Wednesday#t16's meeting#e116 between Elian and his grandmothers at the home of a Roman Catholic nun in Miami Beach, Fla. Sister Jeanne OLaughlin said#e60 after#s4 the meeting#e117 she thought#e61 Elian should stay in the United States.`` First Fruits of the Monstrousness, ''read#e63 the full-page editorial on the front of Friday#t17's edition of the Communist Party daily Granma. It offered#e64 more details and criticisms of the perceived treatment that Elian's grandmothers, Mariela Quintana and Raquel Rodriguez, received#e65 from OLaughlin, the Miami relatives and other anti-Castro Cubans during the encounter#e120. In an interview#e121 with the Spanish language broadcast of CNN, Elian's father also criticized#e66 how the meeting#e123 was handled#e67. He repeated#e68 charges that his relatives and others in Miami had offered#e69 him money to stay#e70 in the United States with his son.`` They are not going#e71 to buy#e72 NX FW, me, ''said#e73 Juan Miguel Gonzalez.`` What is important for me is that they return#e74 the boy to me as soon as possible.
