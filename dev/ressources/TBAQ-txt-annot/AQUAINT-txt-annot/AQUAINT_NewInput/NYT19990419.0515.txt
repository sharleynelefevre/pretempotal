Times News Service With the finding#e1 of a buried rifle 11#t2>days#t2>ago#t2, the authorities in the NAC Buffalo, N.Y., area say#e2 they have gathered#e3 enough evidence in the October#t3 slaying#e4 of Dr. Barnett Slepian to begin#e5 presenting#e6 a murder case to a state grand jury as#s1#s7>early#s7>as#s1#s7 next#t4>week.#t4 A federal grand jury has already been addressing#e7 the slaying#e8 under laws that prohibit#e9 violence#e10 against providers of abortion. Slepian was#e11 the mainstay of Buffalo's only abortion clinic before#s2#s1 he was shot#e12 to death last Oct.#t5>23#t5 at his home in suburban Amherst. But the decision#e13 by District Attorney Frank C. Clark to begin#e14 presenting#e15 evidence to a state grand jury suggests#e16 that he has amassed#e17 enough material to support#e18 a criminal indictment for homicide.`` We ve gotten#e19 to the point where we know#e20 what we want#e21 to introduce#e22 before a grand jury, ''Clark said#e23 in a telephone interview#e24 Monday#t6. Although the authorities are not saying#e25 who the suspect is#e26, all of the attention so far has fallen#e27 on James C. Kopp, a 44-year-old anti-abortion protester who had been traveling#e28 around the country from demonstration to demonstration for#s3#s2 years#t7. Officially, Kopp is being sought#e29 as a `` material witness ''in the case. Clark said#e30 it was easier to seek#e31 extradition#e32 of an indicted suspect from another state or a foreign country than of someone wanted#e33 as a material witness. For now, though, that would be#e34 a theoretical advantage since the authorities have admitted#e35 they have#e36 no idea where Kopp is#e37. Clark said#e38 there was `` no question ''that the finding#e39 of the rifle was#e40 important in his decision#e41 to seek#e42 an indictment#e43. The rifle was discovered#e44 April#t8>8#t8 buried#e45 one foot below the ground, about 200 feet behind Slepian's house. It is undergoing#e46 testing at the FBI laboratory in Washington, but the authorities have said#e47 it resembles#e48 the kind of high-powered rifle used#e49 in the slaying#e50. Clark said#e51 other evidence that prosecutors might present#e52 includes#e53 a strand of human hair found#e54 at the wooded firing site that has a `` high likelihood ''of matching#e55 Kopp's hair and testimony from a jogger who spotted#e56 Kopp's car near Slepian's house at#s5 6#t9>a.m.#t9>ten#t9>days#t9 before#s4#s3 the shooting#e57. There also are videotapes of Kopp's car crossing#e58 the Canadian border around#s4 the days#t16 _ in#s8 1994#t14, 1995#t11 and#s5 1997#t12 _ that three Canadian doctors who perform#e59 abortions were shot#e60 at. None of those doctors were killed#e61. If a suspect is caught#e62 and charged#e63 in UCP both state and federal courts, a state trial would likely precede#e64 a federal one, giving#e65 the authorities two chances to prosecute#e66. New York State double-jeopardy laws would make#e67 it difficult to prosecute#e68 a suspect who had been found#e69 not guilty at a federal trial. U.S. Attorney Denise E. ODonnell declined#e70 to discuss#e71 what federal charges were being pursued#e72, but she said#e73 that in a case like this, potential charges would be#e74 abortion-related violence#e75, the use#e76 of a firearm in an act#e77 of violence, crossing#e78 state lines to commit#e79 a crime, and, if the suspect's act was tied#e80 to an organization, violation of the so-called RICO statutes, which prohibit#e81 an organized criminal enterprise. Slepian, 52, and the father of four boys, was shot#e82 to death at#s6 10#t15>p.m#t15. as he stood#e83 chatting#e84 with his wife in the kitchen of their home in an affluent enclave in Amherst, which is#e85 the largest Buffalo suburb.
