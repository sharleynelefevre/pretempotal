Times News Service WASHINGTON _ The bombings#e83 at the American Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania have frightened#e1 away travelers from East Africa just as Kenya was hoping for an end to a years-old#t11 slump in foreign tourism, and as Tanzania was finally beginning#e3 to reap#e137 the benefits from a major investment in the travel industry. Tour operators who specialize in travel in Kenya and Tanzania, which boast some of Africa's best game parks and sunniest beaches, say#e6 there have been no mass cancellations#e91 as a result of the Aug.#t2>7#t2 Embassy bombings#e92 in Nairobi, the Kenyan capital, and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, which left#e7 more than 250 people dead. But they report#e8 a number of worried calls#e138 from prospective travelers, many of them alarmed by the possibility of more terrorist attacks#e93 in the region.`` People have been calling#e12, and we ve been reassuring#e139 them that we don't see#e14 further problems, ''said#e15 Mary Mkimbo, a spokeswoman in New York for the Kenya Tourist Office. The State Department, which does not want#e16 to see#e17 Kenya and Tanzania punished economically as a result of terrorist attacks#e94 that were clearly targeted#e19 at the United States, has lifted#e20 dire travel warnings issued#e21 just the bombings#e97 that urged#e22 Americans to stay away from the two countries. New public announcements put#e24 out on#s1 Aug.#t3>13#t3 suggest only that Americans `` exercise caution ''when visiting#e26 Kenya and Tanzania. Embassy employees in both cities have gone#e27 back to work#e28, although in new locations. The bombed-out Embassy in Nairobi is expected#e30 to be demolished#e31 after the FBI has finished#e32 gathering#e33 evidence. The embassy in Dar es Salaam suffered#e34 less damage from the blast#e102, although it, too, may have to be razed#e35. For#s1 now#t4, the State Department says#e36, Embassy employees can offer#e37 only emergency consular service. Foreign visitors to Nairobi and Dar es FW, Salaam since the bombings#e104 have noted a reassuringly heavy presence of both police and soldiers on the streets of the two capitals. Crew-cut FBI agents fill many of the luxury hotels in the two cities. Western diplomats and intelligence officials say#e40 there is no reason to believe#e41 that terrorists affiliated with Osama bin Laden, the exiled Saudi millionaire who is accused#e44 of organizing#e45 the Embassy bombings#e108, plan to strike#e46 again soon in either country. Still, the televised images of the charred hulks of the American Embassy buildings will likely haunt the travel industry in East Africa for years.`` The tourism industry is very sensitive to the news media, ''said#e47 Ms. Mkimbo.`` We do expect#e49 a little downward movement in the industry. ''The tourism industry in Kenya has been troubled for years _ in part because of the opening#e114 of new safari destinations in South Africa, in part because of Nairobi's well-deserved reputation for street crime. Tourism industry revenues reportedly dropped#e50 to $ 300 million last#t5>year#t5, down from $ 450 million the year before. The government has responded#e51 to the slump with a series of actions#e118 to lure#e140 tourists back, including a marked improvement in the service of Kenya Airways, the national airline, which has gone#e54 into partnership with KLM Royal Dutch Airlines. The bombing#e120 will doubtless set#e55 back those efforts. Tourism has never been so well-developed an industry in neighboring Tanzania, which is home to Mt. Kilimanjaro, the magnificent wildlife of Serengeti National Park and the exotic island of Zanzibar. But the lack of infrastructure has worked#e57 to Tanzania's advantage in recent years given the dramatic growth in the number of adventure travelers who are willing, even eager to go#e59 without the five-star safari resorts that Kenya offers. The number of visitors to Tanzania jumped#e61 from fewer than 100,000 in#s2 1980#t6 to more than 300,000 last#t7>year#t7, prompting the government to improve#e63 roads needed for safari tours.`` Tanzania has just been underdeveloped for years, and they're beginning#e64 to develop#e65 it now#t8, ''said#e66 Jalal Ebrahim, president of Safaricentre International, a tour operator in Manhattan Beach, Calif. `` There were fewer people in the parks in Tanzania, and that's what attracted visitors. It was more pristine. ''Ebrahim, WP$, whose company has been sending#e67 American travelers on East African safaris for#s3 13#t9>years#t9, said#e68 that his company had received#e69 only one cancellation#e131 as a result of the embassy bombings#e132 _ and that he did not expect#e70 many more.`` We had one cancellation#e133 from a couple who decided they were just going to wait#e72 and see#e73 what happened, ''he said#e75.`` Our clients are adventure travelers and most of them are very savvy. They read#e76 a lot, they stay on top of world events. ''They understand#e78, he said#e79, that increasingly terrorism knows no borders. The U.S. Embassy in Nairobi is now#t10 operating out of the offices of the Agency for International Development on The Crescent, in the neighborhood of Nairobi known as the Parklands; (254-2) 751-613. The Embassy in Dar es Salaam is at 285 Toure Drive; (255-51) 666-015. &QL; NYT-09-07-98 1653EDT &QL;
