Cuban exiles in Miami will now#t2 `` proceed#e58 with all their resources to impede#e57 or delay#e9 ''the decision by the Immigration and Naturalization Service. The government exhorted#e10 citizens to keep#e11 up mass protests#e44 pressing#e12 for Elian's return#e45 until the boy comes#e13 home.`` We can not stop#e14 mobilizing#e15! The struggle must not stop#e16 for#s1 one#t3>minute#t3! ''said#e17 the message, read#e18 during the rally#e48 of several thousand Cuban scientists by Hassan Perez, president of the government's University Students Federation. Cuba appealed#e19 to world opinion, and American opinion in particular, to help#e20 prevent#e21 its enemies in Miami from trying#e22 to block#e23 the child's return#e49. Found#e60 clinging to an inner tube off the coast of Florida in#s1 late#t4>November#t4, Elian has been the subject of an international custody battle#e53. His mother died#e59 trying#e25 to get#e26 Elian and herself to the United States. The boy's father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, lives in Cuba and wants#e27 him back. But Elian's relatives in Miami have fought#e28 to keep#e29 the boy permanently, saying#e30 they could provide#e31 him with a better life than he would have on the communist island. They said#e32 they would appeal#e33 the decision#e55, announced#e34 Wednesday#t5 by INS Commissioner Doris Meissner, that Elian must be returned#e35 to his father by Jan.#t6>14#t6. Gonzalez has not appeared#e36 publicly since the announcement#e56. Neither he nor Elian's four grandparents could be located#e37 Wednesday#t7 in their hometown of Cardenas, east of Havana.
