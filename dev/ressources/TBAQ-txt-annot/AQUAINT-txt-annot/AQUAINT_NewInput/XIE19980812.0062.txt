The bombings#e46 at U.S embassies in Kenya and Tanzania have killed#e14 more than 200 people, including 12 Americans, and wounded#e16 over 5,000. The United States has dispatched#e17 FBI agents to Africa to investigate#e18 the bombings#e47 but there was no word in Washington on#s2 Tuesday#t4 of any significant leads so far. Tanzanian police said#e19 on#s3 Tuesday#t5 they had arrested#e20 14 foreigners in their search#e49 for bombers. The 14 foreigners, six Iraqis, six Sudanese, a Somali national and a Turk, were rounded#e21 up because they failed#e22 to explain#e23 their presence in the country satisfactorily. Albright announced#e24 on#s2 Monday#t6 to offer#e25 a reward of up to 2 million U.S. dollars for information leading to the arrest#e52 and conviction#e53 of the bombers. She told#e27 African envoys that she looked#e28 forward to visiting#e29 Kenya and Tanzania but would wait#e30 until she could do#e62 so without placing undue burdens on the heavily stretched U.S. embassies there. She also said#e34 the bombings#e54 would not prevent#e35 the United States from building `` a strong new relationship with a new Africa. ''Egyptian Ambassador Ahmed Maher el-Sayed, on behalf of the African envoys, condemned#e36 the `` cowardly, criminal and tragic ''bombings#e56.`` Terrorism is inconsistent with our African history, our tradition, our culture and our beliefs, ''he said#e37.`` Americans and Africans need#e38 to strengthen#e39 their cooperation in this universal battle#e59 ''against terrorism.
