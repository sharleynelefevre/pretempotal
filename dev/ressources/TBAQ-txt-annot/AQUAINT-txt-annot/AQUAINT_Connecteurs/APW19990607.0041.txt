FBI Director Louis Freeh said#e3 the U.S. government is offering#e4 a reward of up to  $  5 million for#26#0 information that leads#e5 to the arrest#e6 and#12#0 conviction#e7 of Bin Laden, indicted#e8 as#35#0 the architect of the twin bombings#e9 of American embassies in Kenya and#13#0 Tanzania. The Aug.#t3>7,#t3>1998#t3, bombings#e10 killed#e11 more than 200 people, including 12 Americans. It is#e12 the largest reward the government has ever offered#e13 for#27#0 a fugitive. A total of  $  650,000, meanwhile#2#Temporal, is being offered#e14 for#28#0 information leading#e15 to the arrest#e16 of Kopp, who is charged#e17 with gunning#e18 down Dr. Barnett Slepian last#t4>fall#t4 in his home in Buffalo, N.Y. Slepian provided#e19 legal abortions#e20 in western New York state.

Reno said#e26 Bin Laden and#14#0 Kopp have#e27 one thing in common: Each wrongly believes#e28 he is justified#e29 in using#e30 all means possible to achieve#e31 his goal. They also#7#Expansion have#e32 in common locations unknown#e33 to the authorities. Freeh said#e34 Bin Laden may be hiding#e35 out in Afghanistan, which has been#e36 uncooperative in the case#e37. Kopp, meanwhile#3#Temporal, may have approached#e38 the border with Mexico, but#32#0 it is unknown#e39 whether he crossed#e40 into that country, said#e41 Freeh. Kopp purports#e42 to be#e43 a devout Roman Catholic, and#15#0 the majority of jobs he has held#e44 over#s1 the past#t5>20#t5>years#t5 have been#e47 related to the anti-abortion movement, the Justice Department said#e46 in a news release. State Department international security director Dave Carpenter said#e48 that placing#e49 Bin Laden on the most-wanted list `` underscores#e50 the unwavering commitment#e51 ''by the United States `` to fight#e52 terrorism. ''The FBI continues#e53 to receive#e54 threats from individuals and#16#0 organizations with ties to Bin Laden, Freeh said#e55. Carpenter said#e56 the U.S. government's counterterrorism program has paid#e57 out over  $  6 million in some 20 cases around the world for#30#0 credible information. On the FBI list, Bin Laden and#17#0 Kopp replace#e58 two former Libyan intelligence agents charged#e59 in the Dec.#t6>21,#t6>1988#t6, bombing#e60 of Pan Am Flight 103 that killed#e97 259 people on the plane and#18#0 11 on the ground in Lockerbie, Scotland. The two were removed#e61 from the list after#5#Temporal#s7 Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi agreed#e62 in#s2 April#t7 to hand#e63 them over for#31#0 trial in the Netherlands, a neutral venue. Lamen Khalifa Fhimah and#19#0 Abdel Basset Ali al-Megrahi are charged#e64 with murder, conspiracy to commit#e65 murder and#20#0 violations#e66 of international aviation safety laws. Bin Laden and#21#0 Kopp are#e67 the 455th and#22#0 456th persons to be placed#e68 on the FBI's most wanted list, which began#e69 in#s3 1950#t8. Since#6#0#s4 then#8#0, 427 fugitives have been taken#e70 into custody or#37#0 located#e71, 133 of them as#0#0 a#0#0 result#0#0 of citizen assistance#e72, the FBI said#e73. Six suspects in the Bin Laden investigation are known#e74 to be#e75 in custody in the Metropolitan Correctional Center in New York. Another eight suspects, including Bin Laden, have been charged#e76 but#33#0 not apprehended#e77. Another suspect is awaiting#e78 extradition#e79 from Britain. The FBI says#e80 Bin Laden is#e81 the leader of a terrorist organization known#e82 as#36#0 Al-Aqeda, `` The Base. ''Kopp wears#e83 eyeglasses, walks#e84 with a slight limp, is#e85 5 feet, 10 inches tall and#23#0 weighs#e86 150 to 175 pounds. Slepian was killed#e87 by a single gunshot fired#e88 from a wooded area through a window of his home. Prior#s5>to#s5 the Slepian's shooting#e89, Kopp had traveled#e90 the country and#24#0 world, authorities said#e91. He has been arrested#e92 more than a dozen times during#s6 abortion protests#e93 in seven states and#25#0 Italy, but#34#0 has#e94 no felony convictions. He has used#e95 29 aliases, Freeh said#e96.
