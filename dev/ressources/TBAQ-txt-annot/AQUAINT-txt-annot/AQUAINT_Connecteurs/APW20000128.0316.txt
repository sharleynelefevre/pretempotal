Castro's remarks to a conference#e77 of economists were aimed#e5 at those who say#e6 that Elian should remain in the United States because#1#0 his mother sacrificed#e126 his life to take#e8 her to `` freedom, ''a vision he called#e9 a cliche. He placed#e10 the blame on Lazaro Rafael Munero, who apparently organized#e11 the ill-fated journey#e80 on which Elian's mother Elisabeth Brotons and#12#0 10 other people-- including Munero-- died#e127. Castro called#e14 Munero-- who reportedly drove#e15 a taxi and#13#0 engaged#e16 in unofficial businesses in the Cuban city of Cardenas-- a `` ruffian ''on whom Cuban police had amassed#e128 `` 100 pages of reports. ''According to sources quoted#e17 by the Miami Herald, Munero had fled#e18 to Florida in#s2 June#t2>1998#t2 and#14#0 returned#e19 to Cuba later#7#0#t22>that#t22>year#t22, only to be jailed#e129 for#32#0 several months.`` The mother was practically kidnapped#e20 along with the boy ''to make#e21 the late-November#t19 trip#e83, Castro said#e22. The Cuban leader said#e23 Elian had been especially loved#e24 by his parents because#2#Contingency the mother had earlier#3#0 suffered#e25 seven miscarriages#e84. Earlier#4#0 Friday#t4, Cuba's communist government celebrated#e26 the birth#e85 of independence hero Jose Marti on#s3 Friday#t5 with rallies#e88 calling#e27 for#33#0 the return#e89 of Elian Gonzalez, the `` boy martyr ''at the center of an international custody battle#e91. Tens of thousands of children flooded#e28 Havana's Plaza of the Revolution to deliver#e29 a dual homage to Marti and#15#0 Elian, the 6-year-old Cuban WP$, whose rescue#e93 off Florida's coast two#t6>months#t6>ago#t6 set#e30 off a tug-of-war between relatives living on both sides of the Florida Straits. Wearing their red Communist Pioneer neckerchiefs, a string of young boys and#16#0 girls recited#e32 poems they wrote#e33 for#34#0 Elian, dubbed Cuba's `` boy hero ''and#17#0 `` symbolic child, ''and#18#Expansion for#35#0 Marti, commonly known on the island as#40#0 Cuba's `` teacher ''and#19#0 `` apostle. ''The Communist Party daily Granma compared#e35 Elian with revolutionary icon Ernesto `` Che ''Guevara and#20#0 said#e36 the boy `` has been converted#e130 forever into a symbol of the crimes and#21#0 injustices that imperialism is capable of committing#e37 against an innocent. ''The commemorations were similar to those held#e38 here annually#t8 for#36#0 Marti, the revolutionary and#22#0 poet who fought#e39 for#37#0 Cuba's independence from Spain in#s4 1898#t9. But#10#Comparison this#t10>year#t10, children wore#e40 T-shirts bearing#e103 Elian's portrait with their school uniforms. The commemorations began#e41 early Friday#t11>morning#t11, as#41#0 tens of thousands of Cubans marched#e42 through Havana's streets by torchlight. Similar events#e104 were held#e43 all day in the capital and#23#0 across the island. In Old Havana, hundreds of children marched#e44 around the Parque Central chanting#e105 `` We will save#e45 Elian! ''A small group of girls wore#e46 construction paper handcuffs-- an apparent reference to the government's characterization of Elian's retention in the United States as#42#0 a `` kidnapping#e110. ''Fidel Castro's government has been using#e47 such traditional political events#e111-- along with other rallies#e112 almost every#t12>day#t12-- to draw#e48 attention to the case of Elian, who was rescued#e49 Nov.#t13>25#t13 while#5#0 clinging#e50 to an inner tube. His mother and#24#0 10 others died#e131 at sea while#6#Comparison trying#e51 to reach#e52 the United States. For#38#0 the#t21>past#t21>two#t21>months#t21, Elian's father has demanded#e53 that the boy be returned#e54 to him in Cuba, and#25#0 the U.S. government has said#e55 that father and#26#0 son should be reunited#e132. But#11#Comparison Elian's paternal great-uncle in the United States, backed#e56 by the anti-Castro Cuban American National Foundation, is fighting#e57 in the courts to keep#e58 the boy in Miami. Cuba kept#e59 up its condemnation#e114 of the handling#e115 of Wednesday#t16's meeting#e116 between Elian and#27#0 his grandmothers at the home of a Roman Catholic nun in Miami Beach, Fla. Sister Jeanne OLaughlin said#e60 after#8#0 the meeting#e117 she thought#e61 Elian should stay in the United States.`` First Fruits of the Monstrousness, ''read#e63 the full-page editorial on the front of Friday#t17's edition of the Communist Party daily Granma. It offered#e64 more details and#28#0 criticisms of the perceived treatment that Elian's grandmothers, Mariela Quintana and#29#0 Raquel Rodriguez, received#e65 from OLaughlin, the Miami relatives and#30#0 other anti-Castro Cubans during the encounter#e120.
