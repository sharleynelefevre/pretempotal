No Cuban flags sway from its door and#12#Expansion no political signs pushing#e2 for#29#0 the case of young Elian Gonzalez hang from its windows. But#37#Comparison the opinion of the woman who runs the modest business, which sells everything from prescription drugs to chewing gum and#13#0 toys, carries a lot of weight in this part of Miami. She is Fidel Castro's younger sister, Juanita. While#6#0 her brother is the personification of evil in this neighborhood where Cuban flags fly from beatup Buicks, Juanita Castro is a beloved and#14#0 respected member of this community.

When#10#Contingency asked#e22 if#39#0 she thought#e23 the boy's father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, was being controlled#e24 by the Cuban government even though#3#0 he has been in NAC NAC Bethesda, Md., for#32#0 the#t5>last#t5>week#t5, she frowned#e86.`` I don't know#e26 what Juan Miguel thinks#e27 or#42#0 believes#e28, ''Juanita Castro said#e29.`` What I do#e30 think#e31 is that he should have arrived#e32 in this country at#t7>least#t7>72#t7>hours#t7 after#5#Temporal his son was found#e33 floating#e34 off the coast of Fort Lauderdale. ''`` This has gone#e35 too far. And#20#Expansion it's now#t8 become#e36 a tragedy#e73.

Although#0#Comparison she supports#e54 the cause of Miami's Cubans in their struggle against her brother's government, she said#e55 she prefers#e56 to keep#e57 a low profile when#11#0 it comes to politics.`` I just work#e59 in my pharmacy every#t9>day#t9 and#27#0 I pray#e60 for#34#0 a resolution#e82 in our country (Cuba) that is without violence#e83, ''she said#e61.`` And#28#Expansion I also#9#Expansion pray#e87 for#35#0 this young boy every#t10>day#t10 because#2#Contingency he needs#e62 help#e63.
