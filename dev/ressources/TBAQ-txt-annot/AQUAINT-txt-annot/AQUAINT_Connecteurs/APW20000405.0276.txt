''`` The battle#e53 of Elian has been won#e4-- in judicial terms, in legal terms, in political terms, ''Castro said#e5 as#33#0 he wound#e6 up his speech#e54 at Havana's Karl Marx Theater. Castro's statement#e55 came#e7 less than an hour after#4#Temporal Gregory Craig, attorney for#24#0 Elian's father Juan Miguel Gonzalez, announced#e8 in Washington that the father would be traveling#e9 to the United States Thursday#t3 with his wife, their 6-month-old son, and#12#0 with Fernando Remirez, chief of the Cuban Interests Section in Washington.`` This courageous father will leave#e10 at#s1 4#t4>in#t4>the#t4>morning#t4 (4#t5>a.m.#t5>EDT#t5>Thursday#t5), ''Castro said#e11.`` And#13#0 I, at least, will be there to see#e12 him off. ''He said#e13 the group would be met#e14 on arriving#e15 in NAC Washington by Craig and#14#0 Joan Brown Campbell of the National Council of Churches, who traveled#e16 with Craig on his lightning trip#e57 to Havana on#s2 Wednesday#t6. The Cuban leader said#e17 that the U.S. government still#7#0 did not know#e18 how it would transfer#e19 Elian to his father, but#31#0 that it would happen quickly. The U.S. Immigration and#15#0 Naturalization Service said#e21 earlier#1#0 this#t7>week#t7 that once#8#Temporal Gonzalez arrives#e22 in the United States it will begin#e23 the process to transfer#e24 Elian to his custody from the Miami relatives who have been caring#e25 for#25#0 him since#5#0 he was rescued#e26 off the coast of Florida in#s3 late#t9>November#t9.

But#32#Comparison Gonzalez, backed#e31 by Castro, has demanded#e32 his rights as#34#0 Elian's sole surviving parent and#16#0 insisted#e34 that the child be returned#e35 to him. Elian's mother perished#e74 along with 10 others when#10#0 their boat sank#e36 during#s4 the crossing#e37 from Cuba to the United States.

During#s5 his speech#e63 Wednesday#t10>night#t10, Castro expressed#e41 irritation that much of the rest of the delegation was not granted#e42 visas to travel#e43 to the United States to stay#e44 with Elian while#3#Comparison waiting#e45 out a federal appeal filed#e46 by Elian's Miami relatives and#17#0 assist#e47 in his `` NX rehabilitation. ''`` More important than the doctors are those 12 children ''from Elian's first-grade class in Cuba, Castro said#e48. Cuba had asked#e49 for#27#0 28 visas for#28#0 the trip#e70, for#29#0 Elian's father, his stepmother, his little half-brother, a 5th grade boy cousin, the dozen classmates, and#18#0 a host of teachers, doctors and#19#0 other specialists. Also#9#Expansion on the list was National Assembly President Ricardo Alarcon, who has served#e50 as#35#0 adviser to Gonzalez over the#t12>past#t12>four#t12>months#t12 and#20#0 a senior member of Cuba's communist leadership. Ultimately#0#0, U.S. officials approved#e51 and#21#0 delivered#e52 six visas, for#30#0 the four family members, a pediatrician and#22#0 Elian's teacher from his year in kindergarten.
