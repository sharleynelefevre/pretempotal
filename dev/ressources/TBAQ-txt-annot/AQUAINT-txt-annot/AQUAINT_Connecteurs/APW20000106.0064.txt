Cuban exiles in Miami will now#t2 `` proceed#e58 with all their resources to impede#e57 or#12#0 delay#e9 ''the decision by the Immigration and#6#0 Naturalization Service. The government exhorted#e10 citizens to keep#e11 up mass protests#e44 pressing#e12 for#10#0 Elian's return#e45 until#4#Temporal the boy comes#e13 home.`` We can not stop#e14 mobilizing#e15! The struggle must not stop#e16 for#11#0 one#t3>minute#t3! ''said#e17 the message, read#e18 during the rally#e48 of several thousand Cuban scientists by Hassan Perez, president of the government's University Students Federation. Cuba appealed#e19 to world opinion, and#7#0 American opinion in#0#0 particular#0#0, to help#e20 prevent#e21 its enemies in Miami from trying#e22 to block#e23 the child's return#e49.

But#5#Comparison Elian's relatives in Miami have fought#e28 to keep#e29 the boy permanently, saying#e30 they could provide#e31 him with a better life than he would have on the communist island. They said#e32 they would appeal#e33 the decision#e55, announced#e34 Wednesday#t5 by INS Commissioner Doris Meissner, that Elian must be returned#e35 to his father by Jan.#t6>14#t6. Gonzalez has not appeared#e36 publicly since#3#0 the announcement#e56.
