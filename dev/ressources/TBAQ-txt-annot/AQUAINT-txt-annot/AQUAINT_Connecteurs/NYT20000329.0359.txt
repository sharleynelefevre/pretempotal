Times News Service MIAMI _ Elected officials in and#6#0 around Miami warned#e1 U.S. immigration officials Wednesday#t1 that they should expect#e2 little help from the police here when#4#0 they come#e3 for#18#0 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez, and#7#0 they said#e4 this city could erupt#e5 in violence if#24#0 federal agents tried#e6 to forcibly take#e7 the boy from his great-uncle's house in Little Havana and#8#0 send#e8 him back to Cuba.`` We will not lend#e9 our respective resources, whether they be in the form of police officers or#28#0 any other resources, to assist#e10 the federal government in any way, shape or#29#0 form to inappropriately repatriate#e11 Elian Gonzalez to Cuba, ''said#e12 Alex Penelas, mayor of Miami-Dade County. As#21#0 of Wednesday#t2>evening#t2, Lazaro Gonzalez, the boy's great-uncle and#9#0 temporary guardian, still#1#0 had not signed#e13 an agreement to hand#e14 the child over to immigration officials if#25#0 the Miami relatives lose#e15 a fight#e62 to keep#e16 him when#5#0 the case is heard#e17 in#s1 May#t3 in the 11th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals.`` I won't cooperate#e18 in anything, ''Gonzalez told#e19 a Spanish-language television station.`` The boy lives in my house, and#10#0 they ll have to go#e20 find#e21 him there. ''As#22#0 pressure built#e22 in this city, the home of a large number of Cuban exiles, officials of the Immigration and#11#0 Naturalization Service said#e23 they did not plan#e24 to remove#e25 Elian on#s2 Thursday#t4>morning#t4 even if#26#0 his Miami relatives continued#e26 to defy#e72 them. But#17#Comparison an INS spokeswoman said#e27 the agency would revoke#e28 Elian's permission to stay#e29 in the United States, clearing#e67 the way for#19#0 his return#e68 to Cuba. In Havana, Cuban President Fidel Castro said#e30 that the boy's father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, would travel#e31 to the United States to bring#e32 his son home after#2#Temporal#s3 the custody battle#e70 has been decided#e73 in the courts. Elian's father would be accompanied#e33 by other family members from Cuba, some of the boy's former classmates and#12#0 teachers, and#13#0 psychiatric experts, Castro said#e34 on Cuban television.`` We have the perfect formula for#20#0 reinserting#e35 Elian, ''Castro said#e36. He also#3#Expansion said#e37 that the group would be willing to wait#e38 as#0#0 long#0#0 as#0#0 it takes to bring#e40 the boy back. Asked to comment#e41 on Castro's announcement#e71, a Justice Department spokesman said#e42: `` Certainly it changes#e43 things. How it changes#e44 things is a little hard to say#e45 at this point. If#27#0 the father shows#e46 up in Miami and#14#0 decides to go#e47 and#15#0 ring#e48 the doorbell of his relatives and#16#0 find#e49 his son, well, the family in Miami is on record as#23#0 saying#e50 they would turn#e51 over Elian to him. Whether they actually do#e52 this remains to be seen#e74. ''NYT-03-29-00 2125EST &QL;
