The unusual airing of protests#e63 against President Fidel Castro appeared#e6 aimed#e7 at warning#e8 Cuban citizens that South Florida exiles could still#6#0 force#e9 the reversal#e65 of the U.S. government's decision#e66 to return#e10 Gonzalez to Cuba. Castro attended#e11 a rally#e67 Thursday#t1 by media workers at Havana's Palace of Conventions to demand#e12 Gonzalez's return#e68. For#16#0 weeks#t13 the communist government has held#e13 such rallies#e69 almost daily#t2.`` The case of Elian is for#17#0 today's youth what 40#t4>years#t4 of the blockade, armed invasions#e71, sabotage#e72 and#8#0 attempts#e73 to kill#e14 President Fidel Castro were for#18#0 earlier#0#0 generations, ''said#e15 Cuban journalist Luis Baez, who has written#e16 several books about Cuban emigration to the United States. After#4#0#s1 the rally#e76, state television showed#e17 the Cuban exiles in the streets of Miami-- some of them carrying#e18 signs demanding#e19 `` Freedom for#19#0 Elian, ''the same battle cry regularly chanted#e20 during#s2 rallies#e82 on this side of the Florida Straits. A voiceover to the footage called#e21 the exiles `` criminals ''and#9#0 `` mafia members. ''Hundreds of Cuban-Americans chanting#e22 `` Liberty! Liberty! ''blocked#e23 intersections and#10#0 cut#e24 off access to the Port of Miami. In one case, riot police had to use#e25 tear gas to clear#e27 them. Saying `` nothing is certain ''about Elian's return#e88, Cuba's government exhorted#e28 citizens to keep#e29 rallying#e30, after#5#Temporal#s3 the boy's relatives in Miami said#e31 they would look#e32 for#20#0 ways to get#e33 around Wednesday#t5's ruling#e89 by the U.S. Immigration and#11#0 Naturalization Service to repatriate#e34 the child by#s4 Jan.#t6>14#t6. Cuban exiles in Miami will now#t7 `` proceed#e103 with all their resources to impede#e104 or#23#0 delay#e35 ''the ruling#e91, Cuba predicted#e36 Wednesday#t8.`` We can not stop#e37 mobilizing#e38! The struggle must not stop#e39 for#21#0 one#t9>minute#t9! ''said#e40 a message that was read#e41 Wednesday#t10>night#t10 to several thousand rallying#e42 Cuban scientists. Rescued#e106 on#s5 Nov.#t11>25#t11 by fishermen off the Florida coast, Elian has become#e43 the subject of an international custody battle#e97. His mother died#e105 in a boating accident#e98 trying#e45 to get#e46 Elian and#12#0 herself to the United States. The boy's father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, lives in Cuba and#13#0 wants#e47 Elian back. But#22#Comparison Elian's relatives in Miami have fought#e48 to keep#e49 the boy, saying#e50 they could provide#e51 him with a better life. Since#2#0 the INS decision#e100 was announced#e52 Wednesday#t12, they have said#e53 they will appeal#e54 the decision#e101. Gonzalez has not appeared#e55 publicly since#3#0 the announcement#e102. Neither#1#0 he nor#1#0 Elian's four grandparents could be located#e56 in their hometown of Cardenas, east of Havana. AP-NY-01-07-00 0303
