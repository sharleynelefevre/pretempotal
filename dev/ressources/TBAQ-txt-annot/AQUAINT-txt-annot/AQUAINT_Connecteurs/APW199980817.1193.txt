Albright's visit#e71 to East Africa was designed#e20 in part to demonstrate#e21 U.S. resolve in the face of growing terrorist threats#e104 to Americans. Some Kenyans have complained#e103 that after#9#0#s4 the Nairobi bombing#e74, rescuers gave#e24 priority to finding#e25 American victims and#26#0 to protecting#e26 evidence at the expense of saving#e27 African lives. But#37#Comparison Albright and#27#0 other U.S. officials have strongly disputed#e28 that notion, saying#e29 the priority had been rescuing#e30 all possible, African and#28#0 American. On Friday#t5, when#15#0 Albright set#e31 aside vacation#e77 plans for#19#0 the hastily planned trip#e79 to East Africa, the State Department lifted#e33 a warning against travel to Kenya, WP$, whose economy relies heavily on foreign visitors, to further#2#0 ease#e35 any strain in the aftermath of the tragedy#e84.

''The State Department also#12#Expansion ordered#e40 UCP the departure#e92 of all non-emergency personnel and#31#0 families of employees from the embassy at Islamabad and#32#0 from U.S. consulates in Karachi, Lahore and#33#0 Peshawar. The warnings came#e41 after#10#Temporal Pakistan handed#e42 over to Kenyan officials a suspect in the U.S. Embassy bombings#e95, Mohammed Saddiq Odeh, also#13#Expansion known as#39#0 Mohammad Sadiq Howaida and#34#0 Abdull Bast Awadh. The first batch of evidence from the Nairobi bombing#e96 arrived#e44 over the#t8>weekend#t8 at the FBI lab at the bureau's Washington headquarters and#35#0 is being analyzed#e45, FBI officials said#e46 Monday#t9. Many more shipments are expected#e47, but#38#0 the first batch contained#e48 cotton swabs taken#e49 at the blast#e99 site in hopes of picking#e50 up microscopic residues that could positively identify#e51 what the bomb was made of. A U.S. official said#e53 last#t10>week#t10 that field tests suggested#e54 the presence of a Czech-made plastic explosive called Semtex that has been used#e57 by terrorist groups before#5#0.
