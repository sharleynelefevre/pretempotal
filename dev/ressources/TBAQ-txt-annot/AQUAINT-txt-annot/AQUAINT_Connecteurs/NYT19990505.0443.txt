Times News Service Federal law enforcement officials said#e1 Wednesday#t2 that they had concluded#e2 that James Kopp, an impassioned and#10#0 nomadic opponent of abortion, fired#e3 the shots that killed#e4 a NAC Buffalo, N.Y., abortion-clinic doctor last October#t3. Based on physical evidence _ including a rifle found#e5 in#s1 April#t4 month buried#e6 near the doctor's house and#11#0 a match#e8 between fibers found#e7 near the murder and#12#0 others found#e9 in Kopp's car _ officials said#e10 they had decided#e11 to issue#e12 a warrant for#26#0 his arrest in the killing#e13 of Dr. Barnett Slepian. Kopp, a fugitive, has until#5#0 now been described#e14 only as#33#0 a material witness and#13#0 a nationwide warrant had been issued#e15 so#1#0 that#1#0 he could be held#e16 for#27#0 questioning#e17. There was#e18 no official confirmation of the decision#e19 to upgrade#e20 the warrant, but#31#0 Denise ODonnell, the U.S. attorney for#28#0 the Western District of New York in Buffalo, has scheduled#e21 a news conference#e22 Thursday#t5 to announce#e23 a `` major development#e24 ''in the Slepian murder investigation. Erie County District Attorney Frank Clark, Bernard Tolbert, the special FBI agent in charge of the Buffalo office, and#14#0 other investigators will also#7#Expansion be#e25 there. Since#4#0 there is#e26 no federal homicide statute as#34#0 such, the federal officials said#e27 Kopp could be charged#e28 under the recent Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act, which provides#e29 for#29#0 a sentence#e30 of up to life imprisonment for#30#0 someone convicted#e31 of physical assaults#e32 or#39#0 threats#e33 against abortion providers. If#38#0 Kopp were also#8#Expansion indicted#e34 and#15#0 convicted#e35 on state murder charges, he could face#e36 the death penalty. Slepian, a 52-year-old obstetrician and#16#0 gynecologist who was#e37 the mainstay of Buffalo's only abortion clinic, was shot#e38 to death on#s2 the night of Oct.#t6>23#t6 as#35#0 he stood#e39 in the kitchen of his home in suburban Amherst, N.Y. chatting#e40 with his wife and#17#0 one of his four sons. No weapon was recovered#e41 in the first police searches of the area around Slepian's home. But#32#Comparison on#s3 April#t7>8#t7, investigators, wondering#e42 how the assailant could have emerged#e43 from the woods without fearing#e44 he would be seen#e45 carrying#e46 a rifle, searched#e47 the site of the shooting#e48 once#9#0 more and#18#0 unearthed#e49 a rifle buried#e50 one foot below ground 200 feet behind the Slepian home. Clark, the Erie district attorney, said#e51 afterwards#0#0 that investigators think#e52 the doctor's killer buried#e53 the rifle in#s4 the days#t8 before#2#0#s5 the shooting#e55, unearthed#e56 the weapon to fire#e57 the fatal shots, then#6#0 hurriedly reburied#e58 it and#19#0 fled#e59. The 44-year-old Kopp, who in FBI photographs appears#e60 as#36#0 gaunt and#20#0 scruffily bearded and#21#0 WP$, whose last known addresses were#e61 in Vermont and#22#0 New Jersey, emerged#e62 as#37#0 the focus of the investigation within#s6 two#t9>weeks#t9 of the slaying#e63. A jogger observed#e64 Kopp's car at#s7 6#t10>a.m#t10. near Slepian's home 10#t11>days#t11 before#3#0#s8 the murder#e65, and#23#0, curious#e66 why a stranger would be parked#e67 there so#40#0 early, wrote#e68 down the license plate number.
