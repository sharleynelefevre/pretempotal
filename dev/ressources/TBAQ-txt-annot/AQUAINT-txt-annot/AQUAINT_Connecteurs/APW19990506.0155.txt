(AP)-- An abortion foe who is#e1 the subject of an international manhunt#e2 was charged#e3 with murder Thursday#t2 in the slaying#e4 of a doctor who was cut#e5 down in his kitchen by a sniper's bullet.UCP Federal and#19#0 state arrest warrants were issued#e6 for#13#0 James C. Kopp, 44, of St. Albans, Vt. His whereabouts are#e7 unknown.`` We have#e8 probable cause to believe#e9 this man, James Kopp, is responsible#e12 for#14#0 the death#e11 of Dr. Barnett Slepian, ''FBI agent Bernard Tolbert said#e13. Investigators have been searching#e14 for#15#0 Kopp since#4#0#s1 shortly after#3#Temporal#s2 the Oct.#t3>23#t3 slaying#e15. Up until#7#0#s3 Thursday#t4, however#1#0, they had described#e16 him only as#29#0 a material witness wanted#e17 for#16#0 questioning#e18-- not a suspect. In#0#0 addition#0#0 to a state charge of murder, Kopp faces#e20 a federal charge of violating#e22 the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act by using#e23 deadly force#e24 against an abortion doctor. Both charges carry#e25 up to life in prison. The federal charge also#8#Expansion carries#e26 a fine of up to  $  250,000. The newly filed charges will intensify#e27 the ongoing international manhunt#e28, Tolbert said#e29. In response to the new charges, Canadian officials confirmed#e30 that Kopp is#e31 a suspect in sniper shootings#e32 that injured#e82 abortion doctors in#s4 November#t5 in Vancouver, British Columbia; Winnipeg, Manitoba; and#20#0 Hamilton, Ontario. Investigators would not divulge#e33 the evidence#e34 against Kopp but#18#0 said#e35 last month's discovery#e36 of a scope-equipped rifle buried#e37 near the Slepian home represented#e38 a major breakthrough#e39. Slepian, 52, was shot#e40 with a rifle. Authorities have said#e41 they believe#e42 the weapon may have been buried#e43 in#s5>advance#s5>of#s5 the shooting#e44, with the killer digging#e45 it up to fire#e46 the shot, then#11#Temporal reburying#e47 it and#21#0 fleeing#e48. Kopp also#9#Expansion has been linked#e49, through DNA testing, to a strand of hair found#e50 near where the sniper fired#e51, law enforcement sources have said#e52. Nicknamed#e53 the `` Atomic Dog ''in anti-abortion circles, Kopp had been arrested#e54 in several states since#5#0#s6 1990#t6 for#17#0 protesting#e55 abortion. His car was spotted#e56 in Slepian's suburban Amherst neighborhood in#s7 the weeks#t7 before#2#0#s8 the shooting#e57, and#22#0 was found#e58 abandoned#e59 at New Jersey's Newark International Airport in#s9 December#t8, investigators said#e60. Kopp's stepmother, who married#e61 Kopp's father when#12#0 Kopp was#e62 in his 30s, said#e63 Thursday#t9 from her home in Irving, Texas: `` I would like#e64 to see#e65 him come#e66 UCP forward and#23#0 clear#e67 his name if#27#0 he's not guilty, and#24#0 if#28#0 he's guilty, to contact#e68 a priest and#25#0 make#e69 his amends with society, face#e70 what he did#e71. ''Kopp is#e72 now the second anti-abortion activist being sought#e73 by the FBI as#30#0 a suspect in a fatal attack#e74. Eric Rudolph has been#e75 on the run since#6#0#s10 the January#t10>1998#t10 bombing#e76 of a NAC Birmingham, Ala., abortion clinic that killed#e77 an off-duty police officer and#26#0 maimed#e78 a nurse. He also#10#Expansion is charged#e79 in three Atlanta attacks, including the 1996#t11 Olympic bombing#e80 that killed#e81 one person.
