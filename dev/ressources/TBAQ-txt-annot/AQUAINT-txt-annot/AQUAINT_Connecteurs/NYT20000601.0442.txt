Elian could be forced#e5 to stay#e6 longer if#68#Contingency the Miami relatives who are seeking#e7 asylum for#36#0 the child over his Cuban father's objections pursue further#1#0 appeals#e129. Attorney Kendall Coffey said#e8 his clients were giving#e9 an appeal#e130 to the Supreme Court `` serious consideration. ''The Miami relatives could also#25#Expansion request#e10 a rehearing#e132 before#6#0 the same three-judge panel that issued#e11 Thursday#t2's ruling#e133, or#67#0 before#7#0 the entire 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeal. But#26#Comparison Thursday#t3's decision#e134 made#e12 it clear the family has only 14#t4>days#t4 to decide whether to request#e14 a rehearing#e135 at that level. &UR; &LR; `` Expect no extensions#e136, ''the court instructed#e15. The ruling#e137 follows#e211 six#t5>months#t5 of international family infighting, political recriminations and#43#0 wide-spread protests#e140 in both Miami and#44#0 Cuba over the fate of the 6-year-old boy. His mother died#e200 trying#e17 to smuggle#e18 Elian out of Cuba, and#45#0 it has been difficult for#37#0 family members, Miami community leaders and#46#0 many politicians to separate#e19 attitudes about Cuban leader Fidel Castro from the legal issues involved. The appellate ruling#e143 made#e21 it clear the court takes#e23 no joy in lifting#e24 an obstacle to Elian's return#e144 to Cuba.`` We acknowledge#e25, as#63#0 a widely accepted truth, that Cuba does violate#e27 human rights and#47#0 fundamental freedoms and#48#0 does not guarantee#e28 the rule of law to people living in Cuba, ''wrote#e30 Judge J.L. Edmonson, on behalf of the panel. But#27#Comparison the Immigration and#49#0 Naturalization Service's decision#e148 to deny#e31 Elian an asylum hearing#e149 was `` within the outside border of reasonable choices, ''the opinion read#e151.`` The court neither#3#0 approves#e32 nor#3#0 disapproves#e33 the INS decision#e152 to reject#e34 the asylum applications filed#e35 on plaintiff's behalf, but#28#0 the INS decision#e155 did not contradict (federal law.) ''The judges denied#e36, however#4#Comparison, a request#e156 by Elian's father to name#e37 him instead#0#0 of great-uncle Lazaro Gonzalez as#64#0 Elian's representative in the continued#e38 court proceedings#e157. Making Juan Miguel Gonzalez his son's legal representative would have allowed#e39 him to simply drop#e40 the asylum request#e158 and#50#0 head#e201 for#38#0 home. Elian's great-uncle vowed#e202 to continue#e41 the battle#e159, and#51#0 said#e42 the Miami relatives might sue#e203 for#39#0 visitation while#11#0 the child is in the United States.`` We will keep#e43 fighting#e44 with the laws.. so#66#0 Elian Gonzalez can live in a free country like his mother wanted#e46, ''Lazaro Gonzalez said#e47. President Clinton and#52#0 Attorney General Janet Reno praised#e48 the ruling#e162, with both stressing#e49 their confidence that Juan Miguel Gonzalez is the best person to raise#e50 his child. &UR; &LR; `` As#65#0 I ve said#e51 before#8#0, this is a case about the importance of family and#53#0 the bond between a father and#54#0 son, ''Clinton said#e52 in a written#e53 statement#e165 issued#e54 from Berlin. Elian's father asked#e55 his Miami relatives to end#e56 their court battle#e166 after#16#0#s1 Thursday#t6's ruling#e167 and#55#0 allow#e57 him to finally#2#0 return#e204 home with his son.`` A child should simply be with his parents, always his parents, ''the elder Gonzalez said#e58 through an interpreter. Switching to English, he said#e59, `` I want#e60 to thank#e61 the American people. Thank you. ''Elian was rescued#e62 off the coast of Florida by two American fishermen last#t7>November#t7 after#17#0#s2 the boat he was in capsized#e63. Elian's mother and#56#0 10 others died#e205, but#29#0 the boy survived#e64 by clinging#e65 to an inner tube. Elian's Miami relatives took#e66 in the child, but#30#0 then#24#0 refused#e67 to return#e68 him to his surviving father in Cuba, citing#e70 the harshness of the Castro regime. The Miami relatives applied#e206 for#40#0 political asylum on Elian's behalf, saying#e71 the child did not want#e72 to return#e73 to Cuba. INS agents traveled#e74 to Cuba to interview#e75 the child's father before#9#Temporal the INS rejected#e76 the application for#41#0 asylum, saying#e77 the child's father was the only person authorized#e78 to represent#e79 him. A district court judge upheld#e80 the federal agency. The Miami relatives appealed#e81 that decision#e172, and#57#0 obtained#e82 an injunction#e173 requiring Elian to remain in the United States until#12#Temporal the asylum question worked#e85 its way through the courts. Juan Miguel Gonzalez arrived#e86 in the United States April#t8>2#t8, and#58#0 Reno ordered#e87 the Miami relatives to surrender#e88 the child to his father. The family refused#e89, and#59#0 federal agents took#e90 the child by force in a pre-dawn raid#e175 on the Miami relatives home on#s3 April#t9>22#t9. The father and#60#0 his son lived#e91 for#42#0 a#t10>month#t10 on a large, private estate in Maryland, but#31#0 have recently moved#e92 to an affluent neighborhood in Washington, D.C., to wait#e93 out the rest of their time in the United States. Shortly after#18#0 the appellate panel released#e94 its decision#e176, attorney Coffey filed#e95 an emergency request#e178 to Supreme Court Justice Anthony M. Kennedy (who has jurisdiction over such matters from Florida) requesting#e96 assurance that Elian will remain in the United States until#13#Temporal the full Supreme Court can consider#e98 a formal appeal#e181. But#32#Comparison Reno said#e99 the request#e182 to Kennedy serves#e100 no purpose since#19#0 the injunction#e183 blocking#e101 Elian's return#e184 to Cuba still#20#0 applies. If#69#0 the family fails#e102 to file#e103 an appeal#e185 within 14#t11>days#t11, she said#e104, the soonest Elian would be free to leave#e105 the country would be seven days later#14#Temporal. However#5#Comparison, Justice Department officials said#e106 the appellate court could decide#e207 to waive#e208 the extra seven-day#t15 period. Protesters were beginning#e107 to gather#e108 outside the Miami relatives home even before#10#0 the ruling#e186 was issued#e109. They yelled#e209 and#61#0 wept#e110 when#22#0 the decision#e187 was announced#e111. In a statement#e188 read#e189 on Cuban television, Castro's government expressed#e112 its displeasure at still#21#0 another delay#e190 in Elian's return#e191. The government called#e113 the 14-day#t16 waiting period `` another concession#e192 to the ` mafia "", _ a disparaging term the government frequently uses#e116 to describe#e117 Miami's exile Cuban community. Jose Basulto, founder of Brothers to the Rescue, a Cuban exile group that frequently rescues#e118 Cuban refugees from the Straits of Florida, called#e119 the latest ruling#e195 `` outrageous. ''`` The saga of Elian Gonzalez is a turning#e120 point in relations in the Cuban community and#62#0 the United States, ''Basulto said#e121.`` This day, in the history of their relations with the United States, will be remembered#e122 in the Cuban community in the same way the Bay of Pigs is remembered#e123. ''Cuban exiles failed#e124 to overthrow#e125 Castro in#s4 1961#t12 when#23#0 the communist leader repelled#e210 their invasion#e199 at the Bay of Pigs. END OF STORY NYT-06-01-00 2301EDT &QL;
