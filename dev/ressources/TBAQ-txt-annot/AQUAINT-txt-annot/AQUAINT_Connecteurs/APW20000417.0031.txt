The 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta has been asked#e3 by the U.S. government to suspend#e4 a ruling#e99 by one of its judges that prevents#e5 the removal#e100 of Elian from the country. Such a decision#e101 would allow#e6 the U.S. government to push#e7 for#29#0 the 6-year-old boy's swift reunion#e102 in Washington with his waiting#e103 father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, who wants#e8 to return#e9 to Cuba. He has said#e10 he will wait#e11 out appeals by the Miami relatives seeking#e12 an asylum hearing#e105 for#30#0 Elian before#3#0 the same court-- but#27#Comparison only if#42#0 he has custody of his son. There was growing#e13 apprehension outside the Little Havana home where the boy has lived#e14 with his great-uncle for#31#0 nearly five#t2>months#t2.`` The feeling is the Clinton administration might send#e15 federal agents to pull#e16 him out of here, ''said#e17 Sergio Navarro, a 39-year-old Miami businessman who spent#e18 part of Sunday#t3>night#t3 with chanting#e19 protesters. Elian's relatives have cared#e20 for#32#0 him since#5#0#s1 November#t4, when#10#0 he was found#e21 clinging#e22 to an inner tube in the Florida Straits. His mother and#14#0 10 other people fleeing#e23 Cuba drowned#e142 when#11#0 their boat sank#e24. The Clinton administration has pushed#e25 for#33#0 the boy's return#e112 to his father, ruling#e113 only he can speak#e26 for#34#0 his son on immigration matters. The boy's Miami relatives say#e27 he will have a better life here and#15#0 have attempted#e28 to portray Juan Miguel Gonzalez as#39#0 a pawn of Fidel Castro. The Justice Department wants#e29 the appeals court to suspend#e30 the temporary injunction issued#e31 Thursday#t5 and#16#0 also#13#Expansion order#e118 Elian's great-uncle, Lazaro Gonzalez, to release#e32 the boy. The relatives want#e33 the court to let#e34 them meet#e35 with Elian's father without being required#e36 to surrender#e37 the boy. The court watch comes#e38 after#8#0 one of the most bitter charges yet#26#0 in the custody battle#e122. Juan Miguel Gonzalez lashed#e39 out at his Miami relatives Sunday#t6>night#t6, accusing#e40 them of `` child abuse ''for#35#0 turning#e41 his son against him. He said#e42 they have manipulated#e43 his son to believe#e44 that his mother still#4#0 may show#e45 up someday-- in this country.`` This is child abuse and#17#0 mistreatment, what they're doing#e46 to this boy, ''Gonzalez said#e47 on CBS's `` 60 Minutes. ''`` The way they're abusing#e48 him, turning#e49 him against his father.. he's suffering#e50 more here amongst them than he suffered#e51 in the sea. ''Gonzalez said#e52 he didn't believe a much-publicized video taped at the relatives home in which his son said#e55 he didn't want#e56 to go#e57. He has spoken#e58 with Elian at least three times since#6#0 he arrived#e59 in the United States on#s2 April#t7>6#t7, and#18#0 he insisted#e60 his son wants#e61 to return#e62 to Cuba.`` He's told#e63 me so#44#0, ''Gonzalez said#e64. The Miami relatives are `` putting#e65 a bunch of toys in front of a 6-year-old. He can not decide#e143 for#36#0 himself. The one that decides#e144 for#37#0 him is me, his father. ''Elian's Miami relatives have filed#e66 affidavits alleging#e67 Gonzalez abused#e145 his former wife and#19#0 his 6-year-old son, a charge Gonzalez denied#e68. During#s3 the time of the broadcast#e128 on#s4 Sunday#t8, family members and#20#0 Elian were outside the home of Lazaro Gonzalez and#21#0 did not publicly comment#e69 after#9#0 the show#e129. Protesters, however#0#Comparison, dismissed#e70 Juan Miguel's comments as#40#0 either#2#0 selfish or#2#0 the words of Fidel Castro.`` Fidel Castro is claiming#e71 the son, not him, ''said#e72 Olga Coto, 56, of Miami.`` He's being manipulated#e73 totally by Fidel Castro. He's not telling#e74 the truth. ''Many worried#e75 their efforts to keep#e76 the boy in Miami would fail#e77 today#t9, the 39th anniversary#e132 of the Bay of Pigs fiasco#e133, an aborted invasion#e134 of Cuba by CIA-trained exiles that left#e79 much bitterness among the Cuban-American community.`` We were betrayed#e146 by the government, by (President) Kennedy, and#22#0 if#43#0 they turned#e80 the child back over, it will be a second betrayal#e136, ''said#e81 Josefa Gonzalez, who left#e82 Cuba in#s5 1962#t10 when#12#0 she was 4. Earlier#1#0 Sunday#t11, protesters prayed#e83 for#38#0 divine help as#41#0 Easter#t12>week#t12 began#e84, waving#e85 palm fronds and#23#0 posters of the Cuban boy and#24#0 Jesus. Priests joined#e86 the crowd to offer#e87 a religious service.`` There are many people who tell#e88 us that we should give#e89 up this fight#e138, ''said#e90 Martin Anorga, an evangelical pastor.`` But#28#Comparison we will follow#e91 in the path that the Lord has shown#e92 us, despite those who want#e93 to get#e94 in our way.
