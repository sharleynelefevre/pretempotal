The first round of DNA tests on the hair at the FBI Laboratory here established#e7 a high probability it came#e8 from the same person as#23#0 a hair found#e9 in a New Jersey home where James C. Kopp, a 44-year-old anti-abortion protester, lived#e10 last#t3>year#t3, the official said#e11. The first DNA tests did not exclude#e12 a match between the two strands. Kopp has eluded#e13 authorities since#9#0 they obtained#e14 a warrant for#11#0 him as#24#0 a material witness in the Oct.#t4>23#t4 sniper shooting#e15 of Dr. Barnett Slepian, a 52-year-old obstetrician-gynecologist who performed#e16 abortions.

The FBI is conducting#e28 further#4#0 DNA tests of the hair found#e29 outside Dr. Slepian's home. This more extensive set of tests could enable#e30 officials to declare#e31 an absolute match#e32 between the two hair strands, the first law enforcement official said#e33.`` Ultimately#1#0, we would need#e34 to have#e35 a hair taken#e36 directly from Kopp himself to establish#e37 conclusively the hair from scene is#e39 his, ''the official added#e38. The official said#e40 the hair was#e41 in a cap that authorities found#e42 very near the location from which the sniper is thought#e43 to have fired#e44 the rifle bullet that killed#e45 Slepian as#25#0 he stood#e46 in the kitchen of his home in the Buffalo suburb of Amherst, N.Y. But#10#Comparison The Buffalo News reported#e47 Friday#t6 that the hair was#e48 in a packet, with at least two bullets, that was found#e49 buried#e50 in the ground more than 50 feet from a tree where police believe#e51 the sniper stood#e52 and#20#0 fired#e53. Last#t7>week#t7, FBI Director Louis Freeh, on an official visit#e54 to Mexico, asked#e55 Mexican authorities to join#e56 the hunt#e57 for#14#0 Kopp, federal officials have said#e58. They believe#e59 Kopp was driven#e60 to Mexico by a female friend after#7#0#s2 the shooting#e61, and#21#0 have#e62 a trail of her credit card receipts leading#e63 to Mexico, the federal officials have said#e64. In#0#Expansion addition#0#Expansion, a Customs Service videotape from a border crossing point shows#e65 the woman's car returning#e66 from Mexico, these officials said#e67.

Kopp's 1987 Chevrolet Cavalier was discovered#e72 last#t9>month#t9 at NAC Newark, N.J., International Airport, the FBI said#e73. The car had been#e74 in the long-term lot for#16#0#s6 about two#t11>weeks#t11, said#e75 Greg Trevor, a spokesman for#17#0 the Port Authority of New York and#22#0 New Jersey.
