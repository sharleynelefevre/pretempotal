Elian is finally#2#0 getting#e4 time to reconnect#e63 with his father in a quiet, neutral setting where he is no longer a metaphor for#24#0 the war#e44 between the Cubans. A few miles from his temporary home at Andrews Air Force Base, Senator Bob Smith of New Hampshire, Representative Tom DeLay of Texas, both Republicans, and#13#0 the relatives were treating#e5 the raid#e45 to return#e6 Elian as#0#0 though#0#0 it were a Nazi SS operation#e46. Yet#18#Comparison federal agents had a warrant, were enforcing#e7 US law, and#14#0 entered#e8 the house with the proper force to ensure#e9 minimal resistance#e47 and#15#0 injury#e48. It was a model of efficient law enforcement, guided by due process. The raid#e51 was necessary because#4#Contingency the Gonzalez relatives in Miami, refusing#e10 to return#e11 the boy, made him into a symbol of resistance to Fidel Castro. Elian printed#e13 his name on an application for#25#0 asylum and#16#0 was put#e14 in front of a video camera to say#e15 that he did not want#e16 to go#e17 back to Cuba. The relatives treated#e18 the boy like a political prop. As#30#0 did Castro, a master manipulator of public opinion in Cuba. Had the relatives allowed#e20 Elian to return#e21 to Cuba, they would have denied#e22 the dictator an opportunity to reenergize#e64 support for#26#0 his regime. Juan Miguel Gonzalez apparently is a Castro supporter, but#21#0 that should not disqualify#e65 him from being reunited#e66 with his child. Ever since#7#0 he first learned#e23 that Elian was in Florida last#t2>November#t2, he has been persistent in seeking#e24 the boy's return#e57. Elian has developed#e25 great affection for#27#0 the Miami relatives. It would be ideal if#28#0 they could have returned#e26 him to his father yet#19#0 stayed#e27 in contact while#8#0 their appeal#e60 was pending in court. Negotiations failed#e28, however#3#Comparison, because#5#Contingency they insisted#e29 on taking#e30 the place of the father, rather#6#0 than being treated#e31 as#31#0 concerned, yet#20#0 distant, relatives. Juan and#17#0 Elian Gonzalez will remain in the United States pending the appeal#e61. The father can remain here, but#22#0 he can also#11#Expansion return#e35 to Cuba if#29#0 he wishes#e36. Like any other 6-year-old in the care of a loving parent, Elian should go#e38 wherever that parent wants#e39. NYT-04-24-00 1856EDT &QL;
