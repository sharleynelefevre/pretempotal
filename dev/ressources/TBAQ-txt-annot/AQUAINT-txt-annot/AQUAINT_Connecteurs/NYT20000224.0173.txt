''But#63#Comparison the great-uncle of 6-year-old shipwreck#e131 survivor rafter Elian Gonzalez only ducked#e4 his head and#29#0 walked#e5 faster. In a drama that has divided#e191 his once#20#0 close-knit family and#30#0 may finally#5#0 be resolved#e8 in a court hearing#e133 the#t2>week#t2>of#t2>March#t2>6#t2, Manuel Gonzalez, 59, a soft-spoken bus mechanic, has remained largely out of the glare of television lights. Until#18#0 this#t3>week#t3. He was thrust#e11 into the middle of the swirling#e192 Gonzalez family saga when#21#0 Elian's father, Juan Miguel, sent#e12 a letter to U.S. Attorney Janet Reno asking#e13 that his son be moved#e14 to Manuel Gonzalez's home. Alone among his two brothers and#31#0 two sisters who have fled#e15 Cuba for#54#0 Miami, Manuel Gonzalez believes#e16 Elian should go#e17 back to Cuba to live#e18 with his father. Reno denied#e19 the request#e135, but#64#0 Manuel Gonzalez didn't back#e193 down. In a town where expressing#e20 even the slightest approval for#55#0 Cuban President Fidel Castro can prompt#e21 threats of physical harm, Manuel Gonzalez filed#e22 a motion in federal court asking#e23 for#56#0 custody of Elian so#2#0 that#2#0 he could help#e24 reunite#e194 the boy with his father in Cuba. It was a move that many see#e25 as#74#0 courageous and#32#0 principled, but#65#0 others fear may be foolhardy.`` I have lost#e27 a son, ''Gonzalez told#e28 reporters later#16#Temporal, referring#e29 to his own son's death#e142 due to cancer.`` I am supporting#e30 Juan Miguel because#4#Contingency I know#e31 what it is to lose#e32 a son. Elian should be with his father. ''His sincerity didn't stop#e144 the talk on Little Havana's streets or#77#0 on Miami's ubiquitous Spanish-language radio stations, which buzzed#e33 with callers lambasting#e195 Gonzalez for#57#0 playing#e34 into the hands of a tyrant. A day after#13#0 he was hounded#e196 on the steps of the federal courthouse, Manuel Gonzalez wouldn't come#e35 to the door of his modest home in Miami's Little Havana.`` He must go#e36 to work#e37, ''said#e38 his daughter, Rosa, who said#e39 Gonzalez would prefer#e40 not to talk#e41 about the issue.`` There has been a lot of pressure, and#33#0 he feels this is a family affair. ''After#14#0 weeks of high-profile public sparring#e148 _ with charges of abuse#e150, spying#e43 and#34#0 treachery#e151 flying#e44 back and#35#0 forth across the Florida Straits _ it would seem#e45 the chances are slim that the Gonzalez family could ever heal#e197 the wounds created#e46 by the Elian saga. But#66#Comparison the family has overcome#e47 steep obstacles before#7#0. Long before#8#0 Elian thrust#e153 them into the unrelenting glare of the international spotlight, the Gonzalez clan was a typical example of the conflicts#e155 and#36#0 painful separations#e156 wrought#e48 by the Cuban revolution#e157. Of the nine brothers and#37#0 sisters of Manuel's generation, five have come#e49 to Miami, while#10#0 three remain in Cuba and#38#0 one has passed#e51 away. According to press reports#e159, Caridad Gonzalez, the oldest sister, was the first to come#e53 to the United States, arriving#e54 in#s1 1966#t4. Her brother Delfin, who was imprisoned#e55 as#75#0 an anti-Castro activist in#s6 the 1960s#t5, followed#e56 in#s2 1979#t6. Then#19#Temporal came#e57 another sister, Georgina, in#s3 1983#t7, followed#e58 by Manuel and#39#0 Lazaro in#s4 1984#t8. Of those who stayed#e59 in Cuba, Juan Miguel's father, Juan Gonzalez, seems#e60 the most closely allied with the Cuban government. He worked#e61 as#76#0 a police officer in a Cuban ministry, a position that probably helped#e62 his son _ Elian's father _ get#e63 a job in the Communist island's increasingly lucrative tourism industry. The family's experience#e162 is like that of thousands of others now#t9 split between Miami and#40#0 Cuba, said#e64 Damien Fernandez, a Cuban-American political scientist at Florida International University.`` Cubans value their families above almost anything, but#67#0 the post-1959#t14 politics have managed#e65 to split#e66 thousands of families apart, ''he said#e67. For#58#0 decades, Cuban Americans in Miami were largely cut#e68 off from the families they left#e69 behind. Labeled `` worms ''and#41#0 `` traitors ''by Castro, many weren't able to speak#e70 to _ much less visit#e165 _ their relatives for#59#0 years#t15. The situation began#e71 to relax#e72 in the early#t10>1990s#t10, with the crisis#e167 triggered#e73 by the end#e168 of the former Soviet Union's subsidies. In desperate need of hard currency, Castro relaxed#e74 travel restrictions and#42#0 allowed#e75 Cubans to have U.S. dollars, triggering#e76 a trickle of cash from Miami that soon became#e78 a flood. By some estimates, the 700,000 Cubans living in South Florida _ and#43#0 elsewhere in the United States _ send#e80  $  1 billion a#t11>year#t11 in remittances back to their families on the island.`` The Miami families have become#e81 a lifeline, and#44#0 since#12#0#s5 1990#t12 there has been a great trend toward reconciliation#e175, ''said#e82 Florida International's Fernandez.`` Although#1#Comparison many families are still#17#0 divided by politics, they have learned#e83 to forgive#e84 and#45#Expansion forget#e85 and#46#0 find#e86 common ground. ''Prior to Elian, the Gonzalez family apparently was no different. The branches of the family regularly talked#e87 by telephone and#47#0 the Miami relatives went#e88 back to Cuba for#60#0 several family reunions#e89. But#68#Comparison Elian's case has broken#e90 down the family's fragile truce, with their political differences exacerbated#e91 by the inflammatory rhetoric flying#e92 between Castro's government and#48#0 exile extremists in Miami. After#15#Temporal making his opinions known, Manuel Gonzalez reportedly was ostracized#e95 by his Miami kin, especially Lazaro, who has been keeping#e96 Elian and#49#0 who has gone#e97 to court to try#e99 to keep#e100 the boy here. But#69#Comparison there has been at least one attempt#e179 at a resolution#e180. The day#t13>before#9#Temporal#t13>last#t13>Tuesday#t13's federal court hearing#e181, Manuel went#e101 to Lazaro's home to try#e102 to work#e103 out their differences. Neither#6#0 side would say#e104 what happened#e105, but#70#0 when#22#Contingency Manuel returned#e106 to his house, he was so#78#0 upset he felt#e107 heart palpitations and#50#0 was taken#e108 to a hospital. He was soon released#e109 and#51#0 appeared#e110 to be reasonably healthy when#23#0 he appeared#e111 in court the#t16>next#24#0#t16>morning#t16. But#71#Comparison while#11#0 Cuban exiles outside the courthouse cheered#e112 Lazaro and#52#0 his family, their angry taunts seemed#e113 to shock#e114 Manuel. His lawyer, however#3#Comparison, insists#e115 he will continue#e116 to stand#e117 up for#61#0 what he thinks#e118 is right.`` He's a strong man, ''said#e119 Jeffrey Leving.`` He won't let#e120 anyone intimidate#e121 him from doing#e122 what is in Elian's best interests. ''To his credit, Lazaro Gonzalez has issued#e123 a statement asking#e124 Miami's exiles to respect#e125 his brother's opinions. Manuel Gonzalez has told#e126 reporters that he believes#e127 his family will recover#e128 _ at least partially _ from the divisions Elian's case has brought#e129.`` The wounds of the problem will heal#e198, ''he told#e130 the Los Angeles Times newspaper.`` But#72#Comparison the scars will always be there.
