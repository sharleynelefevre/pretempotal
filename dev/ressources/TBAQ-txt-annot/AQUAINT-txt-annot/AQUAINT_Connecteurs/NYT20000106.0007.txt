Times News Service The New York Times says#e1 in an editorial on Thursday#t9, Jan.#t1>6#t1: &QL; The U.S. Immigration and#10#0 Naturalization Service made#e2 a reasonable decision#e47 Wednesday#t3 in ruling#e48 that Elian Gonzalez, the 6-year-old boy who survived#e3 an ill-fated migrant smuggling trip#e50 across the Florida Straits, should be reunited#e72 with his father back in Cuba. The decision#e51 will inflame#e5 anti-Castro Cubans in Miami, but#5#0 Doris Meissner, the INS commissioner, made#e6 it clear that the service had followed#e7 established policy in the case. Moreover#0#Expansion, by setting#e9 a Jan.#t4>14#t4 return#e52 date, the immigration service allowed#e10 Elian's American relatives time to test#e11 the ruling#e54 in court. Elian was one of 13 Cubans who were trying#e12 to cross#e13 from Cuba to Florida six#t5>weeks#t5>ago#t5 on a 17-foot aluminum powerboat when#4#0 it capsized#e14. Ten of those on board died#e73, including his mother and#11#0 stepfather. The boy clung#e16 to an inner tube for#6#0 two#t6 UCP>days#t6 and#12#0 was plucked#e17 from the Atlantic on#s1 Thanksgiving#t7>Day#t7 and#13#0 brought#e18 ashore. He was immediately released#e19 into the custody of relatives in Miami _ and#14#0 just as#23#0 quickly embraced#e20 as#24#0 a pawn in the poisonous estrangement between Fidel Castro's regime and#15#0 its opponents in exile. This page has argued#e21 from the start#e59 that Elian not be denied#e22 due process because#1#0 of his youth, and#16#0 the INS appears#e23 to have moved#e24 carefully. Elian's great-uncle and#17#0 other American relatives were allowed#e25 to make#e26 their case that he should have a life in Miami. The boy's divorced#e27 father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, was also#2#Expansion interviewed#e28 and#18#0 satisfied#e74 the agency that he had a close and#19#0 involved relationship with his son. The mother's parents also#3#Expansion argued#e29 for#7#0 a return#e61 to Cuba. The INS decided#e75 that under their prevailing policies, Gonzalez met#e30 the test that calls for#8#0 custody reverting#e32 to the sole surviving parent in such cases.`` This little boy, who has been through so#28#0 much, belongs with his father, ''Meissner said#e35 Wednesday#t8, adding#e76 that `` the unique relationship between parent and#20#0 child and#21#0 family reunification has long been a cornerstone of both American immigration law and#22#0 INS practice. ''The White House quickly announced#e36 support for#9#0 the decision#e68. It is unclear how the political side of this affair will play#e37 out. Elian's relatives in Miami have indicated#e38 they plan#e39 to appeal#e40, as#25#0 is their right. Some of their more militant supporters in Miami, decrying#e77 the prospect that the boy will be used#e41 as#26#0 a `` trophy ''by Castro, have indicated#e42 they may try#e43 to disrupt#e44 efforts to reunite#e78 Elian with his father. That would be treating#e45 the boy as#27#0 a trophy in a diplomatic struggle#e70 that predates his birth#e71 by decades. NYT-01-06-00 0006EST &QL;
