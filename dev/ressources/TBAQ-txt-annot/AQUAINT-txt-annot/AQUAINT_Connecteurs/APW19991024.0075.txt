(AP)-- About 500 people attended#e1 a Sunday#t2 night memorial service#e2 for#14#0 the Buffalo-area physician who performed#e3 abortions, one#t3>year#t3 after#3#0#s1 he was killed#e4 by a sniper's bullet. A nurse who was critically injured#e5 in the 1998#t4 abortion clinic bombing#e6 in Birmingham, Ala., was among#e7 those who attended#e8 the interfaith ceremony#e9 at a Presbyterian church for#15#0 Dr. Barnett Slepian. Police kept watch#e10 outside and#6#0 about 25 undercover police were scattered#e11 throughout the crowd.`` Security is#e12 tight, ''said#e13 Marilynn Buckham, of Buffalo Gyn Womanservices, a sponsor of the ceremony#e14.`` But#13#Comparison it's not tonight#t5 we're worried#e16 about. It's all of the other dark nights. ''A memorial service#e20 planned#e17 at the University of Rochester for#16#0#s2 Saturday#t6 was canceled#e18 after#4#Temporal#s3 security plans were leaked#e19. Slepian was killed#e21 on#s4 Oct.#t7>23,#t7>1999#t7 by a sniper hiding#e22 in his backyard.
