(wg) By JANE PERLEZ c. 1999 N.Y. Times News Service INDEPENDENCE, Mo. _ The North Atlantic Treaty Organization embraced#e1 three of its former rivals, the Czech Republic, Hungary and#28#0 Poland on#s1 Friday#t3, formally ending#e2 the Soviet domination#e3 of those nations that began#e4 after#10#0#s2 World War#e5 II and#29#0 opening#e6 a new path for#63#0 the military alliance. In a ceremony#e7 tinged with the personal and#30#0 the emotional at the Truman Presidential Library here, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright watched#e8 X the foreign ministers of the three countries sign#e9 the documents of accession to the alliance, signed#e10 them herself and#31#0 then#24#0 held#e11 them aloft like a victory trophy. Albright, who was born#e12 in Prague and#32#0 fled#e13 just after#11#Temporal#s3 the Communist takeover#e14 in#s4 1948#t4, made#e15 no secret of her joy at her homeland and#33#0 its neighbors joining#e16 the alliance after#12#Temporal#s5 a six#t5>year#t5 trans-Atlantic diplomatic process#e17 led#e18 by the Clinton administration.`` To quote#e20 an old Central European expression, ` Hallelujah, ''''she said#e19. In Poland, Hungary and#34#0 the Czech Republic, the moment was marked#e21 by small-scale public celebrations#e22. In Warsaw, Poland, after#13#0 dark, as#81#0 fireworks lit#e23 the sky, the Polish flag and#35#0 the flag of NATO were raised#e24 side by side near the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in Pilsudski Square In Hungary, NATO members flags were raised#e25 outside the Defense Ministry. And#36#Expansion in Prague, Czech Republic, President Vaclav Havel said#e26 in a statement#e27, `` Never have we been#e28 part of such a broad, solid and#37#0 binding security alliance which at the same time respects#e29 in its essence the sovereignty#e30 and#38#0 will#e31 of our nation. ''The enlargement#e32 of NATO from 16 members to 19 has been#e33 one of the administration's foremost foreign policy goals, one that grew#e34 out of a desire#e35, its proponents said#e36, to cement#e37 the democratic gains#e39 made in the former Warsaw Pact countries after#14#0#s6 the collapse#e38 of communism 10#t6>years#t6>ago#t6. But#72#Comparison the policy also#20#Expansion faced#e40 critics, who argued#e41 that welcoming#e42 these three new countries would draw#e43 a new line across Europe and#39#0 antagonize#e44 the Russians. As#82#0#s7>of#s7 Friday#t7, the border between Western Europe and#40#0 the former Soviet Union moved#e45 to the eastern border of Poland. In her speech#e46, in the small auditorium where dignitaries from the three countries sat#e47 and#41#0 the three foreign ministers flanked#e48 her on the stage, Albright countered#e49 that NATO would now do#e50 `` for#64#0 Europe's East what NATO has already helped#e51 to do#e52 for#65#0 Europe's West. Steadily and#42#0 systematically, we will continue#e53 erasing#e54 _ without replacing#e55 _ the line drawn#e56 in Europe by Stalin's bloody boot. ''Albright also#21#Expansion used#e59 her speech#e60 to articulate#e61 a forward-looking vision for#66#0 NATO, which will celebrate#e62 its 50th anniversary in Washington next#23#0#t8>month#t8, and#43#0 to defend#e63 NATO's potential involvement#e64 in Kosovo. In the aftermath#e66 of the Cold War, she said#e65, NATO must be ready#e67 to face#e68 `` an aggressive regime, a rampaging faction, or#91#0 a terrorist group. And#44#Expansion we know#e70 that if#78#0, past is prologue, we face#e71 a future in which weapons will be#e72 more destructive at longer distances than ever before#7#0. ''The NATO summit#e73, she said#e74, would produce#e75 an initiative#e76 that `` responds#e77 to the grave threat posed#e78 by weapons of mass destruction and#45#0 their means of delivery. ''In Kosovo, where the Yugoslav leader, Slobodan Milosevic, is resisting#e79 the deployment#e80 of NATO-led troops, including 4,000 U.S. soldiers, Albright insisted#e81 that NATO was#e82 the best tool to enforce#e83 a peace settlement#e84.`` We must be#e93 clear in explaining#e86 that a settlement#e87 without NATO-led enforcement#e88 is#e89 not acceptable because#2#Contingency only NATO has#e90 the credibility and#46#0 capability to make#e91 it work#e92, ''she said#e94.`` And#47#Expansion we must be#e95 resolute in spelling#e96 out the consequences#e97 of intransigence, ''she added#e98, referring#e99 to the threat of NATO air strikes#e100 against Milosevic if#79#0 he does not agree#e101 to the deployment#e102. But#73#Comparison in many ways, the day belonged#e103 to the Czech Republic, Hungary and#48#0 Poland, who in order to meet#e104 NATO's standards have had#e107 to cut#e105 the size of their Soviet-style militaries, organize#e106 civilian control of their armies and#49#0 agree#e108 to buy#e109 NATO compatible equipment in#s9 the coming#t9>years#t9. It was the spiritual homecoming#e110 to the West that all three foreign ministers stressed#e111.`` Poland forever returns#e112 where she has always belonged#e113 _ the free world, ''said#e114 Bronislaw Geremek, the foreign minister of Poland, who was#e115 a dissident during#s10 the Communist era#e116. Geremek said#e117 he had brought#e118 some appropriate mementoes from Poland to the Truman library, including a campaign poster from 1989#t10 when#18#0 the anti-communist Solidarity forces won#e119 against the Communists. The poster showed#e120 a picture of Gary Cooper from the film `` High Noon. ''`` It helped#e121 us to win#e122, ''Geremek said#e220.`` For#67#0 the people of Poland, high noon comes#e123 today#t11. ''The Czech foreign minister, Jan Kavan, who lived#e124 in London from#s11 1968#t12, when#19#0 the Soviets invaded#e125 Czechoslovakia, until#17#0#s12 1989#t13, said#e126 he had remained#e127 buoyant during#s13 his opposition work#e128 as#83#0 an emigre by believing#e129 that communism would eventually fall#e130. But#74#Comparison he never dreamed#e131, he said#e132, that his country would become#e133 a member of NATO.`` Accession#e134 to NATO is a guarantee#e135 that we will never again become#e136 powerless victims of any foreign aggression, ''Kavan said#e138. Similarly#0#Expansion, the Hungarian foreign minister, Janos Martonyi, who remembers#e139 the 1956#t14 uprising#e140 as#84#0 a 13-year-old, said#e141 that membership of NATO meant#e142 that Hungary was returning#e143 `` to her natural habitat. ''`` It has been#e144 our manifest destiny to rejoin#e145 those with whom we share#e146 the same values, interests and#50#0 goals, ''he said#e147. But#75#Comparison Martonyi also#22#Expansion emphasized#e148 that Hungary understood#e149 NATO membership carried#e150 with it obligations as#1#0 well#1#0 as#85#0 privileges.`` We shall prove#e151 that new members can indeed#6#0 add#e152 to the weight of the alliance, ''he said#e153. The location for#68#0 Friday s#t15 ceremony#e154 was chosen#e155 by Albright, who as#86#0 secretary of state is#e156 the depository of NATO's accession accords. The secretary made the fairly unorthodox decision#e157 to choose#e158 a site outside Washington because#3#Contingency she wanted#e159 the ceremony#e160 to resonate#e161 with the memories of President Truman, under whom NATO was founded#e162. On#s14 April#t16>4,#t16>1949#t16, on behalf of the United States, Truman's secretary of state, Dean Acheson, signed#e163 the Washington Treaty, which created#e164 NATO. Acheson is Albright's favorite predecessor, her aides said#e165. Formed#e166 in reaction to the threat of the Soviet Union under Stalin, NATO calls#e167 for#69#0 the collective defense#e168 of its members and#51#0 was brought#e169 into being with an original 12 members. The alliance has expanded#e170 three times before#8#0, adding#e171 Greece and#52#0 Turkey in#s15 1952#t17, West Germany in#s16 1955#t18 and#53#0 Spain in#s17 1982#t19. But#76#Comparison never before#9#0 has NATO reached#e172 out to its former Eastern-bloc enemies. The Clinton administration embarked#e173 on the expansion#e174 of NATO in#s18 1993#t20 after#15#Temporal#s19 Clinton met#e175 in Washington with President Havel and#54#0 Lech Walesa, who was#e176 then#25#0 the president of Poland. These conversations#e177 are remembered#e178 by Clinton's foreign policy team because#4#Contingency they took#e179 place after#16#0#s20 the opening#e180 of the Holocaust Museum and#55#Expansion because#5#Contingency they involved#e181 two very different Central European leaders who brought#e182 the same message. Their message#e221 was UCP that NATO should be used#e183 as#87#0 the mechanism to secure#e184 the democratic progress of their countries and#56#0 at the same dissuade#e185 Russia from any more imperial designs. The U.S. ambassador to Poland, Dan Fried, who was#e187 then#26#0 on the National Security Council, said#e186 Friday#t25 that he remembered#e188 being asked#e189 to help#e190 `` turn#e191 this pious wish into a policy. ''In#s21 July#t21>1997#t21, at a summit#e192 in Madrid, Spain, the alliance announced#e193 it would accept#e194 Poland, Hungary and#57#0 the Czech Republic. Romania and#58#0 Slovenia, which had tried#e195 hard to meet#e196 the standards, were turned#e197 away, at least for#70#0 the time being. One problem was how to deal#e198 with the Russians, who vacillated#e199 between outright hostility and#59#Expansion accepting what looked#e200 like the inevitable. In#s22 early 1997#t22, President Boris Yeltsin told#e202 President Clinton he could live#e203 with NATO expansion#e204. But#77#Comparison in order to accommodate the Russians, NATO created#e205 the NATO-Russia Council as#88#0 a consultative body that formalized#e206 relations between Moscow and#60#0 the alliance. Poland has been#e207 sensitive to the reactions#e208 of Russia to its membership of NATO, and#61#0 Geremek has gone#e209 out of his way to reassure#e210 the Russians.`` We want#e211 our membership of NATO to serve#e212 as#89#0 a ` catalyst ''for#71#0 Polish Russian co-operation, ''he said#e213 last#t23>year#t23. Even so#80#0, on the secretary of state's plane carrying Albright and#62#0 the three foreign ministers to the ceremony#e214 Friday#t24, the ministers were asked#e215 whether they could ever foresee#e216 Russia as#90#0 a member of NATO. There was a long pause#e217 among the three ministers. Then#27#Temporal Martonyi replied#e218: `` Silence#e219 is your answer. ''NYT-03-12-99 1841EST &QL;
