Faced with the choice of keeping Elian Gonzalez with relatives in Miami, where the boy has been wooed#e6 with American toys and#23#0 theme-park visits#e94, or#55#0 returning#e7 him to his apparently distraught father in Havana, the Immigration and#24#0 Naturalization Service decided#e137 the boy should go#e8 home by#s1 Jan.#t2>14#t2, INS commissioner Doris Meissner told#e9 reporters.`` This little boy, who has been through so#46#0 much, belongs with his father, ''Meissner told#e11 a news conference#e95.`` The core issue here is the bond between the parent and#25#0 the child. ''The decision#e97 was met#e12 with outrage by Cuban-Americans, who said#e13 the youngster will suffer#e14 under the repressive communist regime of Fidel Castro. Lawyers for#13#0 the boy's family in Miami sent#e15 letters of protest to Attorney General Janet Reno and#26#0 President Clinton and#27#0 said#e16 they were prepared#e17 to file#e18 a court appeal#e100 if#49#0 Reno and#28#0 Clinton spurn#e19 the Gonzalez family. Anti-Castro demonstrators thronged#e138 the street near the local INS office in Miami Wednesday#t3, demanding#e20 that Elian be allowed#e21 to stay#e22.`` Today#t4 is a sad day for#14#0 the US Constitution.. and#29#Expansion for#15#0 the hopes and#30#0 dreams of Elian's mother Elizabeth, ''who died#e139 with nine other adults when#7#0 their boat sank#e23 as#54#0 they attempted#e24 to reach#e25 Florida, said#e26 Roger Bernstein, representing#e27 the Miami Gonzalez family.`` Nobody wants#e28 the boy to be separated#e140 from his father, ''said#e29 Ninoska Perez of the Miami-based Cuban-American National Foundation.`` But#43#Comparison that little boy, by surviving#e31 two#t5>days#t5 on an inner tube, has earned#e141 the right to stay#e32 here in freedom. ''In Havana, the government gave#e33 a guarded first response#e105 to the INS ruling#e106, warning#e107 against `` excessive optimism ''and#31#0 predicting#e35 `` the Cuban-American mafia and#32#0 the extreme right in the U.S. Congress ''would still#3#0 put#e36 up a fight#e109 to keep#e37 the boy. Meissner said#e38 the INS decision#e110 was made after#6#0 two lengthy interviews#e111 with the boy's father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, a hotel worker in Cardenas, Cuba, who Meissner said#e40 is anxious to have Elian returned#e41 to him. Since#5#0 the boy is so#47#0 young, Meissner said#e42, the natural father has the right to speak#e43 for#16#0 Elian. There is `` no information ''that Gonzalez, who was divorced#e44 from Elian's mother, is UCP an unfit father, nor#42#0 that he has been coerced#e142 by the Castro regime into pleading#e45 for#17#0 his son's return#e112, Meissner said#e46. Spencer Eig, an attorney for#18#0 the Gonzalez family in Miami, said#e47 Meissner's assumptions were `` unconstitutional and#33#0 untrue. ''`` Elian can not apply#e143 for#19#0 asylum from persecution by the Fidel Castro government, ''Eig complained.`` If#50#Contingency only his father, who is under the control of the Fidel Castro regime, can do#e48 it for#20#0 him.. that is deeply unfair and#34#0 untrue. ''Meissner gave#e49 no reason for#21#0 the Jan.#t6>14#t6 deadline, and#35#0 it is still#4#0 unclear how Elian would be transported#e50 back to Cuba if#51#0 the Gonzalez family's appeals#e116 are unsuccessful. The INS offered#e51 three options: that Gonzalez come#e52 to pick#e53 up his son, that the family in Miami take#e117 him to Cuba, or#56#0 that a `` third party ''escort#e118 the child to his homeland. Gonzalez _ perhaps under duress from the Castro regime _ has indicated#e54 he does not want#e55 to travel#e56 to Miami, and#36#0 there is `` no way ''the Miami Gonzalezes will assist#e57 in sending#e58 Elian back to Cuba, Perez said#e59. Having a third party escort#e144 Elian frees#e60 the INS from the politically uncomfortable spectacle of having to do#e61 the task itself. The Cuban-American lobby is a locally powerful political force few politicians want#e62 to provoke#e63. Clinton has sought#e64 to distance himself from the controversy#e122 from the start#e123.`` I told#e65 you when#8#0 we started#e66 this I would do#e67 my best to keep#e68 the decision#e124 out of politics, ''Clinton told#e69 reporters in the Rose Garden Wednesday#t7.`` We have done that. ''But#44#Comparison if#52#0 Elian is forced#e70 to go#e71 back to Cuba, `` the Clinton-Gore administration, specifically#0#0 (Vice President) Al Gore, will pay#e72 a high price in terms of votes in Florida, ''Perez said#e73. Cuba experts and#37#0 child custody lawyers said#e74 the INS ruling#e129 was appropriate under the law.`` It's high time ''the boy was sent#e75 back to his birthplace, said#e76 Wayne Smith, a former Clinton administration adviser on Cuba.`` This was a simple child custody case. ''`` Every state court and#38#0 every family court in the United States would award#e133 custody to a surviving parent rather#2#0 than a distant relative who lives#e78 a more prosperous life, ''said#e79 David Abraham, a professor at Miami Law School and#39#0 expert in custody law.`` We may have the Disneylands and#40#0 the Universal Studios and#41#Expansion all the things that were dangled#e80 before#1#0 the little boy's eyes, ''Abraham added.`` But#45#Comparison that's his home. ''With the political implications so#48#0 strong, it's unlikely the case of Elian Gonzalez will be closed#e81 quickly, said#e82 Richard Nuccio, a former Clinton administration Cuba adviser.`` With two members of Congress representing#e83 Elian's family's constituency, I don't see#e85 how Elian could be returned#e86 by the federal government without it going#e87 through the court system, ''Nuccio said#e88.
