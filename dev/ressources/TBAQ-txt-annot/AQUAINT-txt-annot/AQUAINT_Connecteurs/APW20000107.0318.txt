APW20000107.0318 2000-01-07#t0 Cuban Boy's Relatives File Petition APW20000107.0318 NEWS STORY 2000-01-07 22:53 Cuban Boy's Relatives File Petition MIAMI (AP)-- In efforts to prevent#e1 Elian Gonzalez's return#e110 to Cuba, an anti-Castro lawmaker subpoenaed#e164 him Friday#t1 to testify#e165 before#6#0 a congressional committee and#31#0 one of his Miami relatives sought#e2 to become#e3 his legal guardian. Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind., said#e4 he subpoenaed#e166 6-year-old Elian to testify#e167 before#7#0 the Committee on Government Reform on#s1 Feb.#t2>10#t2, so#56#0 he remains in the country while#12#0 the courts consider#e6 his case. About 100 supporters cheered#e7 RRC wildly as#57#0 Elian-- holding#e8 the subpoena in front of his face while#13#0 being held#e9 aloft by a relative-- appeared#e10 outside the house where he has been staying with relatives. He gave#e12 the peace sign before#8#0#s2 heading#e13 back indoors. But#29#Comparison in Cuba, Elian's father was angry about Burton's subpoena.`` What right does that man have? ''Juan Miguel Gonzalez said#e14 during a news conference#e114 in his hometown of Cardenas.`` I am the father of Elian and#32#0 immigration has said#e15 that I am the only one who can speak#e16 for#24#0 him `` Why should it be delayed#e17? Who is he? He is no one. I am the father. ''Elian was found#e18 Thanksgiving#t3>Day#t3 clinging#e116 to an inner tube at sea after#17#0#s3 his mother, stepfather and#33#0 eight other people drowned#e168 while#14#0 trying#e19 to reach#e20 Florida by boat. The boy was placed#e21 with his great-uncle and#34#0 great-aunt in Miami, but#30#0 the Immigration and#35#0 Naturalization Service ruled#e22 Wednesday#t4 that he must be returned#e23 to his father in Cuba by#s4 Jan.#t5>14#t5. The decision#e118 touched#e24 off protests#e119 in the Cuban-American community. Burton, the committee's chairman, said#e25 in a release he `` issued#e26 a subpoena to Elian Gonzalez to ensure#e27 that no precipitous action is taken#e28 until#10#Temporal the Florida State court in Miami can adequately address#e29 the Gonzalez case. ''Burton is an outspoken critic of the Castro regime. A 1996#t20 law named#e30 for#25#0 him and#36#0 Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., strengthened#e31 the 1959#t21 trade embargo#e124 against Cuba. Committee sources who spoke#e32 on the condition of anonymity said#e33 that while#15#0 the subpoena requires#e34 that Elian attend#e35 the hearing#e125 in Washington, it's highly unlikely that his actual appearance will be sought#e36.`` The Congress of the United States is affording#e169 Elian Gonzalez what INS and#37#0 this administration has not, which is his legal right and#38#0 his right to due process, ''said#e37 Jorge Mas Santos, chairman of the Cuban American National Foundation.`` This gives#e38 him the protection that he will not be repatriated#e39 to Cuba between#s5 now#t6 and#39#Expansion Feb.#t7>10#t7. ''Earlier#3#0 Friday#t8, lawyers filed#e40 a petition on behalf of Elian's great-uncle, Lazaro Gonzalez. It is an attempt#e132 by his Miami relatives to get#e41 guardianship and#40#0 then#20#0 to file#e42 for#26#0 applications for#27#0 admission to the United States and#41#0 asylum, said#e43 David Abraham, an immigration law professor at the University of Miami. Neither#5#0 the lawyers nor#5#0 Elian's relatives would comment#e44 before#9#Temporal#s6 the judge's ruling#e137, which is expected#e45 early#t9>next#21#0#t9>week#t9. In Cuba, meanwhile#1#Temporal, tens of thousands of people rallied#e46 in a seaside plaza Friday#t10>night#t10 to demand#e47 his return#e138.`` Elian, Cardenas awaits you.. with kisses, ''a Cuban country music band sang#e48. Also#18#Expansion Friday#t11, Miami-Dade Mayor Alex Penelas and#42#0 Miami Mayor Joe Carollo, accompanied#e49 by one of the family's lawyers, flew#e50 to Washington to appeal#e51 directly to Attorney General Janet Reno. Gov. Jeb Bush also#19#Expansion asked#e52 President Clinton to reverse#e53 the INS order. Reno said#e54 she is considering#e55 the issues raised#e56 in the meeting#e141 and#43#0 the state court action.`` I plan to respond#e58 as#58#0 quickly as#59#0 possible, ''she said#e59 in a statement. Reno has said#e60 she was consulted#e61 on the INS decision#e145 and#44#0 approved#e62 of it. Clinton said#e63 Friday#t12 the INS did the right thing.`` I believe#e64 they followed#e65 the law, ''Clinton said#e66.`` This is a volatile and#45#0 difficult case.:,.. We need#e67 to keep#e68 this out of the political process as#60#0 much#2#0 as#2#0 possible. ''In#0#0 contrast#0#0 to Thursday#t13, when#22#0 two Cuban exile leaders and#46#0 133 other people were arrested#e69 and#47#0 police were forced#e70 to use#e71 tear gas to disperse#e73 a crowd, protesters in Miami were much calmer Friday#t14. However#4#Comparison, the Cuban exile community called#e74 for#28#0 more civil disobedience. About 100 protesters marched#e75 in front of the federal building in Orlando on#s7 Friday#t15>night#t15, waving#e76 Cuban and#48#0 American flags and#49#0 chanting#e77 `` Cuba libre ''and#50#0 `` long live the USA. ''Two men carried#e79 a banner that said#e80 `` President Clinton, Please keep#e81 Elian in the United States. ''Protesters planned a large demonstration#e151 in Little Havana on#s8 Saturday#t16 and#51#0 were planning to drive#e83 around Miami International Airport on Monday#t17.`` If#63#0 the child is sent#e84 back to Cuba without his day in court, all hell is going to break#e86 loose, ''said#e87 Jose Basulto, founder of Brothers to the Rescue, an anti-Castro group. The rally#e154 in Cardenas, Cuba, was marked#e88 by songs, tears and#52#0 personal recollections of Elian. It was the most personal and#53#0 emotional of many held since#16#0#s9 early#t18>December#t18, when#23#0 Cuban President Fidel Castro promised#e90 mass mobilization#e158 until#11#Temporal the boy was returned#e91 to his father. Elian's father, his four grandparents and#54#0 his great-grandmother began#e92 weeping#e93 as#61#0 they sat in a row of chairs facing the stage as#62#0 the group sang#e96 of the boy's mother. Gonzalez looked#e97 particularly distraught, his eyes red from crying#e98. During the day Friday#t19, Elian played#e99 in his relatives yard with a puppy named Dolphin, a gift from Rep. Lincoln Diaz-Balart, R-Fla. The black Labrador chased#e101 Elian around the yard and#55#0 playfully nipped#e170 at his blue soccer shorts.`` Elian tells#e102 me he does not want#e103 to go#e104 back to Cuba, ''said#e105 Delfin Gonzalez, another of Elian's great-uncles. He said#e106 Elian wants#e107 his family to come#e108 here. AP-NY-01-07-00 2253
