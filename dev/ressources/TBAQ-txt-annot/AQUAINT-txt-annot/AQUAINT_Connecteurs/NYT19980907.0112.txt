Times News Service WASHINGTON _ The bombings#e83 at the American Embassies in Kenya and#26#0 Tanzania have frightened#e1 away travelers from East Africa just as#46#0 Kenya was hoping for#16#0 an end to a years-old#t11 slump in foreign tourism, and#27#0 as#47#0 Tanzania was finally#8#0 beginning#e3 to reap#e137 the benefits from a major investment in the travel industry. Tour operators who specialize in travel in Kenya and#28#0 Tanzania, which boast some of Africa's best game parks and#29#0 sunniest beaches, say#e6 there have been no mass cancellations#e91 as#0#Contingency a#0#Contingency result#0#Contingency of the Aug.#t2>7#t2 Embassy bombings#e92 in Nairobi, the Kenyan capital, and#30#0 Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, which left#e7 more than 250 people dead. But#43#Comparison they report#e8 a number of worried calls#e138 from prospective travelers, many of them alarmed by the possibility of more terrorist attacks#e93 in the region.`` People have been calling#e12, and#31#0 we ve been reassuring#e139 them that we don't see#e14 further#7#0 problems, ''said#e15 Mary Mkimbo, a spokeswoman in New York for#17#0 the Kenya Tourist Office. The State Department, which does not want#e16 to see#e17 Kenya and#32#0 Tanzania punished economically as#1#0 a#1#0 result#1#0 of terrorist attacks#e94 that were clearly targeted#e19 at the United States, has lifted#e20 dire travel warnings issued#e21 just the bombings#e97 that urged#e22 Americans to stay away from the two countries. New public announcements put#e24 out on#s1 Aug.#t3>13#t3 suggest only that Americans `` exercise caution ''when#14#Contingency visiting#e26 Kenya and#33#0 Tanzania. Embassy employees in both cities have gone#e27 back to work#e28, although#3#Comparison in new locations. The bombed-out Embassy in Nairobi is expected#e30 to be demolished#e31 after#11#Temporal the FBI has finished#e32 gathering#e33 evidence. The embassy in Dar es Salaam suffered#e34 less damage from the blast#e102, although#4#Comparison it, too, may have to be razed#e35. For#18#0 now#t4, the State Department says#e36, Embassy employees can offer#e37 only emergency consular service. Foreign visitors to Nairobi and#34#0 Dar es FW, Salaam since#13#0 the bombings#e104 have noted a reassuringly heavy presence of both police and#35#0 soldiers on the streets of the two capitals. Crew-cut FBI agents fill many of the luxury hotels in the two cities. Western diplomats and#36#0 intelligence officials say#e40 there is no reason to believe#e41 that terrorists affiliated with Osama bin Laden, the exiled Saudi millionaire who is accused#e44 of organizing#e45 the Embassy bombings#e108, plan to strike#e46 again soon in either#9#0 country. Still#12#Comparison, the televised images of the charred hulks of the American Embassy buildings will likely haunt the travel industry in East Africa for#19#0 years.`` The tourism industry is very sensitive to the news media, ''said#e47 Ms. Mkimbo.`` We do expect#e49 a little downward movement in the industry. ''The tourism industry in Kenya has been troubled for#20#0 years _ in part because#5#0 of the opening#e114 of new safari destinations in South Africa, in part because#6#0 of Nairobi's well-deserved reputation for#21#0 street crime. Tourism industry revenues reportedly dropped#e50 to  $  300 million last#t5>year#t5, down from  $  450 million the year before#10#0. The government has responded#e51 to the slump with a series of actions#e118 to lure#e140 tourists back, including a marked improvement in the service of Kenya Airways, the national airline, which has gone#e54 into partnership with KLM Royal Dutch Airlines. The bombing#e120 will doubtless set#e55 back those efforts. Tourism has never been so#45#0 well-developed an industry in neighboring Tanzania, which is home to Mt. Kilimanjaro, the magnificent wildlife of Serengeti National Park and#37#0 the exotic island of Zanzibar. But#44#Comparison the lack of infrastructure has worked#e57 to Tanzania's advantage in recent years given the dramatic growth in the number of adventure travelers who are willing, even eager to go#e59 without the five-star safari resorts that Kenya offers. The number of visitors to Tanzania jumped#e61 from fewer than 100,000 in 1980#t6 to more than 300,000 last#t7>year#t7, prompting the government to improve#e63 roads needed for#22#0 safari tours.`` Tanzania has just been underdeveloped for#23#0 years, and#38#0 they're beginning#e64 to develop#e65 it now#t8, ''said#e66 Jalal Ebrahim, president of Safaricentre International, a tour operator in Manhattan Beach, Calif. `` There were fewer people in the parks in Tanzania, and#39#0 that's what attracted visitors. It was more pristine. ''Ebrahim, WP$, whose company has been sending#e67 American travelers on East African safaris for#24#0 13#t9>years#t9, said#e68 that his company had received#e69 only one cancellation#e131 as#2#0 a#2#0 result#2#0 of the embassy bombings#e132 _ and#40#Expansion that he did not expect#e70 many more.`` We had one cancellation#e133 from a couple who decided they were just going to wait#e72 and#41#Expansion see#e73 what happened, ''he said#e75.`` Our clients are adventure travelers and#42#0 most of them are very savvy. They read#e76 a lot, they stay on top of world events. ''They understand#e78, he said#e79, that increasingly terrorism knows no borders. The U.S. Embassy in Nairobi is now#t10 operating out of the offices of the Agency for#25#0 International Development on The Crescent, in the neighborhood of Nairobi known as#48#0 the Parklands; (254-2) 751-613. The Embassy in Dar es Salaam is at 285 Toure Drive; (255-51) 666-015. &QL; NYT-09-07-98 1653EDT &QL;
