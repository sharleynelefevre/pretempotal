SNIFFEN Associated Press Writer WASHINGTON (AP)-- The Justice Department is reviewing#e1 whether alcohol-related driving violations#e97 or#48#0 other actions#e98 by Elian Gonzalez relatives in Miami warrant moving#e4 the 6-year-old boy to a different, temporary custodian.`` That matter is under review, ''Deputy Attorney General Eric Holder said#e5 when#15#0 asked#e6 Thursday#t1 about the violations#e100.`` We will look#e7 at that, try#e8 to make#e9 some kind of factual determination and#17#0 then#14#0 decide#e149 what steps, if#49#0 any, need#e11 to be taken#e12. ''In#1#Expansion addition#1#Expansion, the department is still#7#0 considering#e13 a request#e103 last#t2>week#t2 from Elian's father in Cuba, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, to have Elian's temporary custody shifted#e14 from his great-uncle Lazaro Gonzalez to another great-uncle, Manolo Gonzalez. Both great-uncles live in Miami. Juan Miguel Gonzalez objected#e16 to the media access to Elian that Lazaro Gonzalez's family has permitted#e17 and#18#0 to the treatment of Elian by psychologists selected#e18 by Lazaro Gonzalez's family. Meantime#2#0, the possibility of a meeting#e107 between Attorney General Janet Reno and#19#0 Lazaro Gonzalez's family reemerged#e19 Thursday#t3. Reno agreed#e20 to a meeting#e108 earlier#3#0 this#t4>week#t4, only to have Lazaro Gonzalez's family withdraw#e21 the request. But#34#Comparison discussions#e110 have been renewed#e22, a Justice official said#e23 Thursday#t5. Later#6#Temporal Thursday#t6, two of Elian's Miami cousins sought#e24 support on Capitol Hill for#39#0 legislation that would help#e25 keep#e26 the boy in America. One of them, Marisleysis Gonzalez, told#e27 a news conference#e113 that reports of alcohol-related violations#e115 by relatives should not have bearing on the custody case.`` We're doing#e29 what's in Elian's best interest. My family is a very close family, ''she said#e30. Another cousin, Georgina Cid, said#e31 Elian's father had intended#e32 to flee#e33 Cuba himself, but#35#0 was being coerced#e150 by the Castro government to stay#e34 and#20#0 make#e35 certain statements.`` He wanted#e36 to reunite with his son-- but#36#0 not in Cuba, ''Cid said#e37. She said#e38 she and#21#0 other family members had spoken#e39 to Elian's father by phone both before#0#0 and#0#0 after#0#0 the mother perished#e151. The father's response when#16#Contingency learning#e40 that his boy was safe in Miami was `` take#e120 care#e121 of him until#9#Temporal I can go#e41, meaning#e42 go#e122 to the United States, ''Cid said#e43. A group of Florida lawmakers introduced#e152 legislation this#t7>month#t7 to grant#e44 Elian American citizenship, which would take#e45 the decision#e154 about Elian's future#t8 away from INS and#22#0 give#e46 it to a Florida family court. Support for#40#0 the bill has been waning#e47. Reno has already met#e48 with Lazaro Gonzalez's lawyer and#23#0 a Catholic nun from Miami who oppose#e49 his return#e125 to Cuba, as#4#0 well#4#0 as#47#0 with Elian's two grandmothers from Cuba, who want#e50 him returned#e51. In Havana, Elian's father joined#e52 President Fidel Castro on#s1 Thursday#t9 in a packed#e53 auditorium in what has become#e54 a daily#t10 public rally#e126 to press#e55 for#41#0 the boy's return#e127. Speaker after#11#0 speaker denounced#e56 the United States and#24#0 extolled#e153 the virtues of Cuba's communist revolution#e128. A Justice official, who requested#e57 anonymity, said#e58 the department has authority, if#50#0 necessary, to shift#e59 temporary custody to someone other than Lazaro Gonzalez. The boy was placed#e60 in his care after#12#0#s4 being found#e61 clinging#e62 to an inner tube in the Atlantic last#t11>Thanksgiving#t11 following#e63 a boat wreck#e132 that killed#e64 his mother and#25#0 10 other people. The Immigration and#26#0 Naturalization Service has ruled#e65 in favor of the father's request#e134 that the boy be returned#e66 to him in Cuba, but#37#0 that decision#e135 was put#e67 on hold while#10#0 the Miami relatives battle#e68 in federal court to keep#e69 him in this country. Holder said#e70 that INS acted#e71 appropriately but#38#0 `` now#t12 that we have this new information, we ll have to look#e72 at it, and#27#0 see#e73, like I said#e74, what steps if#51#0 any are appropriate. ''Florida state records show#e76 Lazaro Gonzalez, 49, was found#e77 guilty of driving#e78 under the influence of alcohol at least twice from 1991#t13 to#s2 1997#t14. Records also#13#Expansion show#e79 Lazaro Gonzalez's 62-year-old brother, Delfin Gonzalez, has been found#e80 guilty at least twice of driving#e81 under the influence. On#s3 Wednesday#t15, Ricardo Alarcon, head of Cuba's National Assembly and#28#0 Castro's key man for#42#0 U.S.-Cuban relations, said#e82 the convictions#e141 prove#e83 the homes of those uncles are no place for#43#0 Elian.`` Practically everyone surrounding him either#5#0 has been, or#5#0 may be in the#t16>future#t16, joining#e84 the prison system in the U.S. That's not the best interest of the child, ''Alarcon told#e85 reporters in Havana. He said#e86 Elian was `` surrounded by two drunks. ''Armando Gutierrez, a spokesman for#44#0 the Miami relatives, dismissed#e87 the criticism#e143: `` Elian is surrounded by love. ''Elian's relatives and#29#0 other Miami supporters say#e88 his mother died to give#e89 him freedom. The newspaper of Cuba's Communist Party, daily#t17 Gramma, published#e90 a letter Thursday#t18 from Elian's grandmothers to Reno and#30#0 Immigration and#31#0 Naturalization Service Commissioner Doris Meissner asking#e91 for#45#0 Elian's return#e146.`` No material good exists#e92 that can compete#e93 with the value of the family, and#32#0 it is humiliating for#46#0 us that people are still#8#0 questioning#e94 our love and#33#0 the#t19>future#t19 that awaits Elian at his home, ''said#e95 a Spanish version of the letter, dated#e96 Feb.#t21>4.#t21 AP-NY-02-10-00 2013
