Lublin X X @ Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal 10/27/89 WALL STREET JOURNAL (J) GM JAGRY F EUROP TENDER OFFERS, MERGERS, ACQUISITIONS (TNM) AUTOMOBILES (AUT) LONDON General Motors Corp. wants to buy as#46#0 much#3#0 as#3#0 15 % of Jaguar PLC, marking its first salvo in a possible full-scale battle against Ford Motor Co. for#22#0 control of the British car maker. GM sought U.S. antitrust clearance last week to purchase more than  $  15 million worth of Jaguar shares but#18#0 doesn't own any yet#21#0, according to GM officials UCP here and#33#0 at the company's Detroit headquarters. The No. 1 U.S. auto maker then#17#0 wrote Jaguar that it intends `` to go to that 15 % ''level once#15#Temporal it wins the U.S. clearance to go beyond  $  15 million, a Jaguar spokesman said yesterday. The GM move follows Tuesday's declaration by Ford, which holds an unwelcome 12.45 % stake in Jaguar, that it is prepared to bid for#23#0 the entire company. GM is close to completing a friendly deal with Jaguar that is likely to involve an eventual 30 % stake and#34#0 joint manufacturing ventures. Speculative investors, betting on an imminent clash between Ford and#35#0 GM, pushed up Jaguar's share price five pence (eight U.S. cents) to a near-record 720 pence ( $  11.60) in late trading on London's stock exchange yesterday. Since#11#0 Tuesday, the shares have gained nearly 4 %. But#19#Comparison an all-out bidding war between the world's top auto giants for#24#0 Britain's leading luxury-car maker seems unlikely.`` We will not go over a certain level, ''said David N. McCammon, Ford's vice president for#25#0 finance, at a news conference yesterday in Dearborn, Mich. `` There's some price at which we'd stop bidding. ''He wouldn't specify what it was. And#36#Expansion powerful political pressures may convince the Conservative government to keep its so-called golden share, which limits any individual holding to 15 %, until#9#Temporal the restriction expires on Dec. 31, 1990.`` I really don't see the government doing something that Jaguar doesn't want over the next#12#0 14 months, ''said Kenneth Warren, a Conservative member of Parliament and#37#0 chairman of the Select Committee on Trade and#38#0 Industry in Britain's House of Commons.`` The golden share is a single share, but#20#0 it is the magic share. ''The government retained the single share after#10#Temporal selling its stake in Jaguar in 1984-- part of a nationalistic practice of protecting former government-owned enterprises to deflect criticism of privatization. The 15 % restriction covers any would-be suitor, UCP British or#49#0 foreign. Ford is willing to bid for#26#0 100 % of Jaguar's shares if#48#0 both the government and#39#0 Jaguar shareholders agree to relax the anti-takeover barrier prematurely. As#47#0 Jaguar's biggest holder and#40#0 Britain's biggest car maker, Ford could turn up the heat by convening a special shareholders meeting and#41#0 urging holders to drop the limits early. Ford might succeed because#4#Contingency many shareholders are speculators keen for#27#0 a full bid or#50#0 institutional investors unhappy over Jaguar management's handling of its current financial difficulties. The government probably wouldn't give in readily to a hostile foray by Ford, however#1#0. It has relinquished a golden share only once#16#0 before#5#0-- during British Petroleum Co. s #2.5 billion ( $  4 billion) takeover of Britoil PLC in 1988. In wooing British lawmakers, GM has pointed out that its willingness to settle for#28#0 a minority stake would keep Jaguar British-owned and#42#0 independent. This week, the U.S. auto giant paid for#29#0 10 NAC House of Commons members and#43#0 two NAC House of Lords members to fly to Detroit and#44#0 tour its operations there. While#7#0 the visit was unrelated to Jaguar, GM Chairman Roger Smith answered the legislators questions about it over lunch Tuesday. He said Jaguar `` shouldn't be smothered by anyone else#13#0, ''recalled one participant. Politics also#14#Expansion influences the government's thinking on the anti-takeover restriction. The Conservatives don't dare jeopardize marginal Tory seats in Coventry, where Jaguar has headquarters, nor#32#0 can the government easily back down on promised protection for#30#0 a privatized company while#8#0 it proceeds with controversial plans to privatize most of Britain's water and#45#0 electricity industries. Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher might, however#2#Comparison, be receptive to any request by Jaguar Chairman Sir John Egan for#31#0 the restriction's early removal to let GM amass more than 15 % or#51#0 mount a friendly suitor bid against Ford. In#0#0 the#0#0 end#0#0, Sir John-- rather#6#0 than the government or#52#0 Jaguar shareholders-- may hold the key that unlocks the golden share.
