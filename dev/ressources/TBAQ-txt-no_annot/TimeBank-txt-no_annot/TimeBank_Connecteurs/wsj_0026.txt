Duty-Free Status Cleared @ For#2#0 Certain Watch Imports 11/02/89 WALL STREET JOURNAL (J) MONETARY NEWS, FOREIGN EXCHANGE, TRADE (MON) EXECUTIVE (EXE) WASHINGTON The White House said President Bush has approved duty-free treatment for#3#0 imports of certain types of watches that aren't produced in `` significant quantities ''in the U.S., the Virgin Islands and#11#0 other U.S. possessions. The action came in response to a petition filed by Timex Inc. for#4#0 changes in the U.S. Generalized System of Preferences for#5#0 imports from developing nations. Previously#0#0, watch imports were denied such duty-free treatment. Timex had requested duty-free treatment for#6#0 many types of watches, covered by 58 different U.S. tariff classifications. The White House said Mr. Bush decided to grant duty-free status for#7#0 18 categories, but#16#0 turned down such treatment for#8#0 other types of watches `` because#1#0 of the potential for#9#0 material injury to watch producers located in the U.S. and#12#0 the Virgin Islands. ''Timex is a major U.S. producer and#13#0 seller of watches, including low-priced battery-operated watches assembled in the Philippines and#14#0 other developing nations covered by the U.S. tariff preferences. U.S. trade officials said the Philippines and#15#0 Thailand would be the main beneficiaries of the president's action. Imports of the types of watches that now will be eligible for#10#0 duty-free treatment totaled about  $  37.3 million in 1988, a relatively small share of the  $  1.5 billion in U.S. watch imports that year, according to an aide to U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills.
