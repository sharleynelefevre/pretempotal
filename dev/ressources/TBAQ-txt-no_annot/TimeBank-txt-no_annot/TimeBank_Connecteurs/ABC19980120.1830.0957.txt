People have predicted his demise so#22#0 many times, and#6#0 the US has tried to hasten it on several occasions.UCP Time and#7#0 again, he endures. He has outlasted and#8#0 sometimes outsmarted eight American presidents. Fidel Castro invited John Paul to come for#15#0 a reason.

Those observers looking for#19#0 a battle between uncompromising representatives and#10#0 very different ideologies will, in all likelihood, be disappointed. Castro has said that you can be a Communist and#11#0 still#3#0 be a Christian. He says he and#12#0 the Pope both want to end the exploitation of man by man. The question is who will Cubans believe? The main negative is the risk that the Pope's visit will persuade a great many more Cubans to break loose of the Cuban government. If#21#0 so#23#0, then#21#0 the Pope's visit would really open up a new chapter in the government's relations with its own society. For#20#0 the Cuban government, that is the risk. At the end of the broadcast this evening, one more trip around Havana to see what it's been like since#4#0 the last time. And#13#Expansion in just a moment Diane Sawyer will have some other news.
