Jefferson @ Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal 10/26/89 WALL STREET JOURNAL (J) MGMG RAM TENDER OFFERS, MERGERS, ACQUISITIONS (TNM) REAL ESTATE, REITS, LAND DEVELOPMENT (REL) CASINOS AND#8#0 GAMBLING (CNO) STOCK MARKET, OFFERINGS (STK) BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. MGM Grand Inc. has agreed to pay  $  93 million and#9#0 nearly 1.8 million common shares to buy 117 acres of land along the NAC Las Vegas, Nev., Strip as#28#0 a site for#5#0 its planned movie-studio and#10#0 theme-park resort. Of the total purchase price,  $  50 million cash and#11#0  $  30 million in stock (nearly 1.8 million shares) would be paid to buy the existing 700-room Marina Hotel amp Casino from Southwest Securities, a Nevada limited partnership. The remaining properties to be acquired are the Tropicana Country Club amp Golf Course, a facility jointly owned by Ramada Inc., of NAC NAC Phoenix, Ariz., and#12#0 NAC the Jaffe family, and#13#0 a small parcel owned by MGM Grand director James D. Aljian. The purchase price was disclosed in a preliminary prospectus issued in connection with MGM Grand's planned offering of six million common shares. The luxury airline and#14#0 casino company, 98.6 %- owned by investor Kirk Kerkorian and#15#0 his Tracinda Corp., earlier#1#0 this month announced its agreements to acquire the properties, but#27#0 didn't disclose the purchase price. The proposed stock offering and#16#0 issuance of nearly 1.8 million common shares in connection with the land purchase will bring MGM Grand's total shares outstanding to 28.7 million, of which 72 % will be owned by Mr. Kerkorian and#17#0 Tracinda, according to the prospectus. In over-the-counter trading, MGM Grand was bid at  $  17.50 a share. Proceeds from the offering are expected to be used for#6#0 remodeling the company's Desert Inn resort in Las Vegas, refurbishing certain aircraft of the MGM Grand Air unit, and#18#0 to acquire the property for#7#0 the new resort. The company said it estimates the Desert Inn remodeling will cost about  $  32 million, and#19#0 the refurbishment of the three DC-8-62 aircraft, made by McDonnell Douglas Corp., will cost around  $  24.5 million. MGM Grand said the latest stock offering won't cover the  $  600 million or#29#0 more cost of building the proposed resort and#20#0 theme park, and#21#0 added it will need to seek additional financing, either#2#0 through bank borrowings or#2#0 debt and#22#0 equity offerings, at a later#3#0 date. Construction is set to begin in early 1991. The resort will include the MGM Grand Hotel, a multi-spired, castle-like facility that will include 5,000 rooms and#23#0 85,000 square feet of casino space. The facility will be marketed toward families, and#24#0 room rates will be between  $  35 and#25#0  $  55 a night, MGM Grand said. The prospectus didn't include many details about the studio and#26#0 theme park, although#0#Comparison conceptual drawings, released this month, show that it may feature several `` themed ''areas similar to those found at parks built by Walt Disney Co.
