MALAYSIA's aggressive move into the information age could not come in a more opportune time. With the convergence of communications and#25#0 information technologies (IT) coupled with the coming of age for#13#0 the Internet and#26#0 its related technologies, the stage is set for#14#0 Malaysians to seize the chance to transform into a knowledge society and#27#0 become worthy opponents/players in the global market space. The Internet, the global network of computers, is now far reaching into the country- extending its embrace to include every nook and#28#0 cranny of the nation- opening doors to not only a diverse range of information sources but#23#0 also#7#0 an exhaustive list of possibilities to create new applications which add value to people's lives. In the business world, the Internet- through intranet and#29#0 extranet solutions- has become an invaluable tool for#15#0 companies to harness so#48#0 as#41#0 to gain a competitive edge. The solutions are also#8#Expansion vital components in developing the borderless marketing flagship application which is a vital element for#16#0 spearheading the development of the Multimedia Super Corridor (MSC) project. The application will create the necessary framework and#30#0 infrastructure to support electronic commerce (e-commerce) initiatives in the country. However#1#Comparison, it is important to note that installing or#49#0 implementing Internet technologies for#17#0 technology's sake would not ensure instant success. For#18#0 e-commerce to flourish with full-blown end-to-end business transactions, strategic planning which incorporates both business and#31#0 technology plans that are complementary is necessary for#19#0 an organisation to see feasible returns on investment. Intranets, through the use of Internet technology, are positioned as#42#0 a platform for#20#0 companies to optimise, expand and#32#0 transform new channels of business. When#6#Contingency strategically implemented, an intranet solution will provide the ability to mediate mission-critical, decision support functions in organisations. It will also#9#Expansion help further#4#0 improve communications and#33#0 collaboration at all levels in an organisation. With intranets in place, it is only logical for#21#0 organisations to respectively link the network to other companies ''for#22#0 extended business purposes through extranets. While#5#0 this will enable the sharing of information among enterprises, security issues such as#43#0 firewalls and#34#0 encryption as#3#0 well#3#0 as#44#0 access and#35#0 control procedures, and#36#0 the trust levels that enterprises have with each other will emerge and#37#0 there will be a need to address them. Other than usage in business, Internet technology is also#10#Expansion beginning to infiltrate the lifestyle domain.`` Smart homes ''have emerged bringing a wealth of information and#38#0 entertainment to families over telecommunications lines. The art of socialising is also#11#Expansion experiencing a change where Net/virtual relationships are fast overtaking or#50#0 becoming parallel with the normal human relationships. Whether this would prove positive or#51#0 otherwise#0#0 towards society in the future is yet#40#0 to be seen. All in all, the Internet has a lot to offer. However#2#Comparison, its value and#39#0 benefits are only as#45#0 good as#46#0 how we use it.
