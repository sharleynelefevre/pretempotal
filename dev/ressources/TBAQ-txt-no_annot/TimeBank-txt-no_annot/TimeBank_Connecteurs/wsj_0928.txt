Sun Microsystems Inc. @ Posts 1st-Quarter Net @ Totaling  $  5.2 Million 10/26/89 WALL STREET JOURNAL (J) SUNW EARNINGS (ERN) COMPUTERS AND#11#0 INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (CPR) MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. Sun Microsystems Inc., snapping back to profitability after#4#0 its first quarterly loss as#24#0 a public firm, said it earned  $  5.2 million, or#25#0 seven cents a share, in the fiscal first quarter. Sun, a maker of computer workstations, reported sales of  $  538.5 million for#17#0 the quarter ended Sept. 29, up 39 % from  $  388.5 million a year earlier#1#0. In the 1988 period, the company earned  $  20.6 million, or#26#0 26 cents a share. Sun's results were slightly better than expectations. Earlier#2#0 this month, the company said it expected to break even for#18#0 the quarter on sales of  $  530 million. In a statement, Scott McNealy, Sun's NX chief executive officer, said the company's performance was hampered by problems tied to the introduction of a major new family of computers in April. One of those new computers, called Sparcstation 1, accounted for#19#0 nearly half of the 28,000 systems Sun shipped in the quarter, he said. More than two-thirds of the systems shipped, meanwhile#0#0, were products introduced in April. But#16#Comparison problems in manufacturing, forecasting demand and#12#0 getting the bugs out of a new management information system made it extremely difficult for#20#0 Sun to meet demand for#21#0 its newest computers well into the summer. These problems also#6#Expansion resulted in Sun reporting a  $  20.3 million loss for#22#0 its fourth quarter ended June 30. Mr. McNealy said the issues that hurt Sun's performance earlier#3#0 this year are now ''largely ''behind the firm, and#13#0 he indicated that Sun's profitability should increase throughout the fiscal year. Sun also#7#Expansion reported a record backlog of orders. While#5#0 this indicates continued strong demand for#23#0 the company's desk-top computers, Sun faces increasing competition from Digital Equipment Corp. and#14#0 Hewlett-Packard Co. Recently, analysts have said Sun also#8#Expansion is vulnerable to competition from International Business Machines Corp., which plans to introduce a group of workstations early next#9#0 year, and#15#0 Next#10#0 Inc.
