Pierre Goad X X @ Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal 10/26/89 WALL STREET JOURNAL (J) T.PGI WNEWS TENDER OFFERS, MERGERS, ACQUISITIONS (TNM) MONTREAL In a stunning shift in direction, Provigo Inc. said it will sell all its non-food operations to concentrate solely on its retail and#12#0 wholesale grocery business. The non-food operations accounted for#6#0 about 27 % of Provigo's 7.38 billion Canadian dollars ($, US$ 6.3 billion) in sales in the latest fiscal year. In a related move, Pierre Lortie, chairman and#13#0 chief executive, resigned. Mr. Lortie joined Provigo in 1985 and#14#0 spearheaded the company's drive to grow outside its traditional food business. He couldn't be reached for#7#0 comment. Bertin Nadeau, newly appointed NX NX chairman and#15#0 NX interim chief executive of Provigo, wouldn't say if#28#0 Mr. Lortie was asked to leave.`` Mr. Lortie felt less pertinent, ''Mr. Nadeau said, given the decision to dump Provigo's non-food operations.`` At this stage it was felt I was perhaps more pertinent as#30#0 chief executive. ''Mr. Nadeau also#5#Expansion is chairman and#16#0 chief executive of Unigesco Inc., Provigo's controlling shareholder. At a news conference, Mr. Nadeau said the sale of the three non-food businesses, which account for#8#0 nearly half the company's $, C$ 900 million in assets, should be completed in a `` matter of months. ''The three units are a nationwide UCP pharmaceutical and#17#0 health-products distributor, a small sporting-goods chain, and#18#Expansion a combination catalog showroom and#19#0 toy-store chain. Investors and#20#0 analysts applauded the news. Provigo was the most active industrial stock on the Montreal Exchange, where it closed at $, C$ 9.75 ($, US$ 8.32), up 75 Canadian cents.`` I think it's a pretty positive development, ''said Ross Cowan, a financial analyst with Levesque Beaubien Geoffrion Inc., of the decision to concentrate on groceries. Mr. Lortie's departure, while#2#0 sudden, was seen as#31#0 inevitable in light of the shift in strategy.`` The non-food operations were largely Mr. Lortie's creation -LCB- and#21#0 -RCB- his strategy didn't work, ''said Steven Holt, a financial analyst with Midland Doherty Ltd. Provigo's profit record over the past two years tarnished the company's and#22#0 Mr. Lortie's reputations. For#9#0 the six months ended Aug. 12, Provigo posted net income of $, C$ 6.5 million, or#33#0 eight Canadian cents a share, compared with $, C$ 18.1 million, or#34#0 21 Canadian cents a share, a year earlier#0#0. Sales were $, C$ 4.2 billion compared with $, C$ 3.7 billion. Last month, Canadian Bond Rating Service downgraded Provigo's commercial paper and#23#Expansion debentures because#1#0 of its lackluster performance. Analysts are skeptical Provigo will be able to sell the non-food businesses as#32#0 a group for#10#0 at least book value, and#24#0 are expecting write-downs. Mr. Nadeau said he couldn't yet#11#0 say if#29#0 the sale prices would match book values. He said all three non-food operations are profitable. Mr. Nadeau said discussions are under way with potential purchasers of each of the units. He declined to confirm or#35#0 deny reports that Provigo executive Henri Roy is trying to put together a management buy-out of the catalogue showroom unit. Mr. Roy couldn't be reached. Yvon Bussieres was named senior NX NX executive vice president and#25#0 NX chief operating officer of Provigo, a new position. Mr. Bussieres was president and#26#0 chief operating officer of Provigo's Quebec retail and#27#0 wholesale grocery unit. Mr. Nadeau said he intends to remain Provigo's chief executive only until#4#Temporal the non-food businesses are sold, after#3#0 a which a new chief executive will be named.
