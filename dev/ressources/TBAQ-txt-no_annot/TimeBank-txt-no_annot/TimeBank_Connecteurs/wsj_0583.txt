Lehner @ Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal 10/30/89 WALL STREET JOURNAL (J) J.SNE TENDER OFFERS, MERGERS, ACQUISITIONS (TNM) HOME ELECTRONICS, FURNISHINGS, APPLIANCES (HMF) TOKYO Polly Peck International Inc.'s agreement to acquire 51 % of Sansui Electric Co. proves that foreign companies can acquire Japanese companies-- if#50#0 the alternative for#16#0 the Japanese company is extinction. Polly Peck, a fast-growing British conglomerate, will pay 15.6 billion yen ( $  110 million) for#17#0 39 million new shares of Sansui, a well-known maker of high-fidelity audio equipment that failed to adjust to changing market conditions. Japanese government officials, eager to rebut foreign criticism of Japanese investments overseas, hailed the transaction as#44#0 proof foreigners can make similar investments in Japan. Polly Peck's chairman, Asil Nadir, echoed the official Japanese view of the accord, which was announced Friday.`` The myths that Japan is not open to concerns from outside has, I think, been demolished at a stroke, ''Mr. Nadir said. But#10#Comparison analysts say Sansui is a special case. It expects to post a loss of 6.4 billion yen for#18#0 the year ending tomorrow and#29#0 its liabilities currently exceed its assets by about 13.8 billion yen.`` If#51#0 you find sound, healthy companies in Japan, they are not for#19#0 sale, ''said George Watanabe, a management-consultant at Tokyo-based Asia Advisory Services Inc. Statistics on acquisitions by foreigners vary in detail, because#0#Contingency unlike Sansui, which is listed on the Tokyo and#30#0 Osaka stock exchanges, most of the Japanese companies acquired by foreigners are privately held. But#11#Comparison by all accounts foreign companies have bought only a relative handful of Japanese companies this year, while#2#0 Japanese companies have acquired hundreds of foreign companies. Nor#28#Expansion do analysts expect the Sansui deal to touch off a fresh wave of foreign purchases. If#52#0 the strong yen and#31#0 the high stock prices of Japanese companies weren't deterrents enough, webs of cross-shareholdings between friendly Japanese companies and#32#0 fiercely independent Japanese corporate attitudes repel most would-be acquirers. Usually when#9#0 a Japanese company is ready to sell, it has few alternatives remaining, and#33#0 the grim demeanors of Sansui's directors at a joint news conference here left little doubt that this was not the company's finest hour. Sansui was once#7#0 one of Japan's premier makers of expensive, high-quality stereo gear for#20#0 audiophiles. But#12#Comparison in recent years, the market has moved toward less expensive `` mini-component ''sets, miniaturized NX NX amplifiers and#34#0 NX receivers and#35#0 NX software players that could be stacked on top of each other. Some of Sansui's fellow audio-specialty companies, such as#45#0 Aiwa Co. and#36#0 Pioneer Electric Corp., responded to the challenge by quickly bringing out mini-component products of their own, by moving heavily into the booming compact disk businesses or#53#0 by diversifying into other consumer-electronics fields, including laser disks or#54#0 portable cassette players. Sansui was late into the mini-component business and#37#0 failed to branch into other new businesses. As#46#0 the yen soared in recent years, Sansui's deepening financial problems became a vicious circle. While#3#0 competitors moved production offshore in response to the sagging competitiveness of Japanese factories, Sansui lacked the money to build new plants in Southeast Asia.`` Our company has not been able to cope very effectively with ''changes in the marketplace, said Ryosuke Ito, Sansui's president. But#13#Comparison even a Japanese company that looks like a dog may turn out to be a good investment for#21#0 a foreign concern, some management consultants maintain. Yoshihisa Murasawa, a management consultant for#22#0 Booz-Allen amp Hamilton (Japan) Inc., said his firm will likely be recommending acquisitions of Japanese companies more often to foreign clients in the future.`` Attitudes -LCB- toward being acquired -RCB- are still#6#0 negative, but#14#0 they're becoming more positive, ''Mr. Murasawa said.`` In some industries, like pharmaceuticals, acquisitions make sense. ''Whether Polly Peck's acquisition makes sense remains to be seen, but#15#0 at the news conference, Mr. Nadir brimmed with self-confidence that he can turn Sansui around. Sansui, he said, is a perfect fit for#23#0 Polly Peck's electronics operations, which make televisions, videocassette recorders, microwaves and#38#0 other products on an `` original equipment maker ''basis for#24#0 sale under other companies brand names. He said Polly Peck will greatly expand Sansui's product line, using Sansui's engineers to design the new products, and#39#0 will move Sansui's production of most products other than sophisticated audio gear offshore into Polly Peck's own factories.`` Whatever capital it (Sansui) needs so#55#0 it can compete and#40#0 become a totally global entity capable of competing with the best in the world, that capital will be injected, ''Mr. Nadir said. And#41#Expansion while#4#0 Polly Peck isn't jettisoning the existent top-management structure of Sansui, it is bringing in a former Toshiba Corp. executive as#47#0 NX NX executive vice president and#42#0 NX chief operating officer. Such risk taking is an everyday matter for#25#0 the brash Mr. Nadir, who is 25 % owner of Polly Peck as#1#0 well#1#0 as#48#0 its chairman. He took Polly Peck, once#8#0 a small fabric wholesaler, and#43#0 used it at as#49#0 a base to build a conglomerate that has been doubling its profits annually since#5#0 1980. In September, it announced plans to acquire the tropical-fruit business of RJR Nabisco Inc.'s Del Monte foods unit for#26#0 #557 million ( $  878 million). Last month, Polly Peck posted a 38 % jump in pretax profit for#27#0 the first half to #54.8 million from #39.8 million on a 63 % rise in sales. Joann S.
