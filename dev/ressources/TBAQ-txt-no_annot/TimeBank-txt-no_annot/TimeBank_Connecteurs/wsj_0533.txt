Two Rival Bidders @ Extend Offers @ To Buy Connaught @-- X @ By Suzanne McGee @ Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal 10/30/89 WALL STREET JOURNAL (J) CSESF F.INM Z.CIG CHIR EUROP RHPOY CANDA TENDER OFFERS, MERGERS, ACQUISITIONS (TNM) MEDICAL AND#12#0 BIOTECHNOLOGY (MTC) TORONTO Two rival bidders for#6#0 Connaught BioSciences extended their offers to acquire the Toronto-based vaccine manufacturer Friday. Institut Merieux S.A., which offered 942 million Canadian dollars ($, US$ 801.2 million), or#20#0 $, C$ 37 a share for#7#0 Connaught, said it would extend its bid, due to expire last Thursday, to Nov. 6. A $, C$ 30-a-share bid by Ciba-Geigy Ltd., a pharmaceutical company based in Basel, Switzerland, and#13#0 California-based Chiron Corp., a bioresearch concern, was extended to Nov. 16. It had been due to expire Friday evening. Merieux previously#1#0 said it would ensure its bid remained open pending a final decision by Canadian regulators on whether to approve the takeover. Merieux, a vaccine and#14#0 bioresearch firm based in Lyon, France, is controlled 50.1 % by state-owned Rhone Poulenc S.A. The Canadian government previously#2#0 said Merieux's bid didn't offer enough `` net benefit ''to Canada to be approved, and#15#0 gave Merieux an X until#4#0 mid-November to submit additional information. Merieux officials said last week that they are `` highly confident ''the offer will be approved once#5#Temporal it submits details of its proposed investments to federal regulators. Both offers are conditional on regulatory approvals and#16#0 enough shares being tendered to give the bidders a majority of Connaught's shares outstanding. Institut Merieux, which already holds a 12.5 % stake in Connaught, said that at the close of business Thursday, 5,745,188 shares of Connaught and#17#0 $, C$ 44.3 million face amount of debentures, convertible into 1,826,596 common shares, had been tendered to its offer. At the close of business Thursday, Ciba-Geigy and#18#0 Chiron said 11,580 common shares had been tendered to their offer. At last report, Connaught had 21.8 million shares outstanding. Separately#3#Expansion, the Ontario Supreme Court said it will postpone indefinitely a ruling on the lawsuit launched by the University of Toronto against Connaught in connection with the Merieux bid. In a statement prepared by lawyers for#8#0 the university and#19#0 Connaught, the parties said they agreed that as#0#0 a#0#0 result#0#0 of reaching a C415 million research accord, `` It is unnecessary that there be a judgment on the merits -LCB- of the case -RCB- at this time. ''Lawyers for#9#0 the two sides weren't immediately available for#10#0 comment. The university had sought an injunction blocking Connaught's board from recommending or#21#0 supporting an offer for#11#0 the company by Merieux.
