RJR Is Selling @ Candy Brands @ For#9#0  $  370 Million @-- X @ By Peter Waldman @ Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal 10/30/89 WALL STREET JOURNAL (J) RJR Z.NES TENDER OFFERS, MERGERS, ACQUISITIONS (TNM) FOOD PRODUCTS (FOD) RJR Nabisco Inc. said it agreed to sell its Baby Ruth, Butterfinger and#16#0 Pearson candy businesses to Nestle S.A.'s Nestle Foods unit for#10#0  $  370 million. The sale, at a higher price than some analysts had expected, helps the UCP food and#17#0 tobacco giant raise funds to pay debt and#18#0 boosts Nestle's 7 % share of the U.S. candy market to about 12 %. The candy businesses had sales of about  $  154 million last year, which was roughly 12 % of total revenue for#11#0 RJR's Planters LifeSavers unit, according to a memorandum distributed by RJR's owner, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts amp Co., to bankers last December. The Nestle acquisition includes a candy plant in Franklin Park, Ill., which employs about 800 workers. The sale, which had been expected, is part of KKR's program to pay down  $  5 billion of a  $  6 billion bridge loan by February. Roughly  $  2 billion of that debt has already been repaid from previous asset sales, and#19#0 RJR expects to use another  $  2 billion from the pending, two-part sale of most of its Del Monte unit. That sale, however#1#Comparison, could still#6#0 fall through if#25#0 financing problems develop. Thus#7#Contingency, it remains crucial for#12#0 RJR to obtain top dollar for#13#0 its smaller assets like the candy brands. Louis Gerstner Jr., chairman and#20#0 chief executive officer of New York-based RJR, called the sale a `` significant step ''in the company's divestiture program, as#2#0 well#2#0 as#26#0 a `` a strategic divestiture. ''Since#5#0 KKR bought RJR in February for#14#0  $  25 billion of debt, it has agreed to sell nearly  $  5 billion of RJR assets. RJR's executives have said they will dispense with certain brands, in#0#0 particular#0#0, that aren't leaders in their markets.`` RJR Nabisco and#21#0 Planters LifeSavers will concentrate more on our own core businesses, ''Mr. Gerstner said Friday. Baby Ruth and#22#0 Butterfinger are both among the top-selling 15 chocolate bars in the U.S., but#8#0 RJR's overall#3#0 share of the roughly  $  5.1 billion market is less than 5 %. Nestle's share of 7 % before#4#0 Friday's purchases is far below the shares of market leaders Hershey Foods Corp. and#23#0 Mars Inc., which have about 40 % and#24#0 36 % of the market, respectively.`` This means Nestle is now in the candybar business in a big way, ''said Lisbeth Echeandia, publisher of Orlando, Fla.-based Confectioner Magazine.`` For#15#0 them, it makes all kinds of sense. They ve been given a mandate from Switzerland ''to expand their U.S. chocolate operations. Nestle S.A. is based in Vevey, Switzerland. The new candy bars, `` make an important contribution to our Nestle Foods commitment to this very important strategic unit, ''said C. Alan MacDonald, president of Nestle Foods in Purchase, N.Y.
