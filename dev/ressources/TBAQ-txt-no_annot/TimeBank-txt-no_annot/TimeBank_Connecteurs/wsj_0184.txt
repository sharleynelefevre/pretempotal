Upjohn Co. said it will offer an early retirement package to as#13#0 many as#14#0 1,100 employees in a cost-cutting move expected to result in a fourth-quarter charge. Upjohn officials said they couldn't estimate the size of the charge until#6#Temporal they determine which employees, and#11#0 how many, will participate in the retirement plan. But#9#Comparison the pharmaceutical company said it `` anticipates the long-term savings resulting from the plan's implementation will more than offset short-term costs. ''The program, available to Upjohn employees 55 years old or#15#0 older, could increase an individual's retirement benefits 10 % to 20 %. In#0#Expansion addition#0#Expansion, Upjohn is offering a one-time retirement bonus equal to six months of base pay.
