Chip by Intel @ Contains Flaw X @ In Calculating @-- X X @ ` Bugs ''Could Stall Makers @ Of Certain Computers; X @ Most Users Unaffected @-- X @ By Stephen Kreider Yoder @ Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal 10/27/89 WALL STREET JOURNAL (J) INTC IBM CPQ SEMICONDUCTORS, INTEGRATED CHIPS (SEM) COMPUTERS AND#30#0 INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (CPR) Intel Corp.'s most powerful computer chip has flaws that could delay several computer makers marketing efforts, but#26#0 the `` bugs ''aren't expected to hurt Intel and#31#0 most computer makers. Computer experts familiar with the flaws, found in Intel's 80486 chip, say the defects don't affect the average user and#32#0 are likely to be cleared up before#10#0 most computers using the chip as#62#0 their ''brains ''appear on the market sometime next#19#0 year. Intel said that last week a customer discovered two flaws in its 80486 microprocessor chip's `` floating-point unit "",, a set of circuits that do certain calculations. On Friday, Intel began notifying customers about the bugs which cause the chip to give wrong answers for#51#0 some mathematical calculations. But#27#Comparison while#13#0 International Business Machines Corp. and#33#0 Compaq Computer Corp. say the bugs will delay products, most big computer makers said the flaws don't affect them.`` Bugs like this are just a normal part of product development, ''said Richard Archuleta, director of Hewlett-Packard Co.'s advanced systems development. Hewlett announced last week that it planned to ship a computer based on the 486 chip early next#20#0 year.`` These bugs don't affect our schedule at all, ''he said. Likewise#2#0, AST Research Inc. and#34#0 Sun Microsystems Inc. said the bugs won't delay their development of 486-based machines.`` We haven't modified our schedules in any way, ''said a Sun spokesman. To switch to another vendor's chips, `` would not definitely be an option, ''he said. Nonetheless#0#Comparison, concern about the chip may have been responsible for#52#0 a decline of 87.5 cents in Intel's stock to  $  32 a share yesterday in over-the-counter trading, on volume of 3,609,800 shares, and#35#0 partly responsible for#53#0 a drop in Compaq's stock in New York Stock Exchange composite trading on Wednesday. Yesterday, Compaq plunged further#9#0, closing at  $  100 a share, off  $  8.625 a share, on volume of 2,633,700 shares. Most of Compaq's decline is being attributed to a third-quarter earnings report that came in at the low end of analysts expectations. Intel said it had corrected the problems and#36#0 would start producing bugless chips next#21#0 week.`` We should not be seeing any more, ''said Bill Rash, Intel's director for#54#0 the 486 chip. What's more, the bugs only emerge on esoteric applications such as#63#0 computer-aided UCP design and#37#0 scientific calculations, he said, and#38#0 then#17#0 very seldom.`` These errata do not affect business programs, ''he said. The bugs will cause problems in `` specific and#39#0 rare circumstances that will not occur in typical applications ''such as#64#0 word-processing and#40#0 spreadsheets, said Michael Slater, editor of the Microprocessor Report, an industry newsletter. Sun, Hewlett-Packard and#41#0 others say Intel isn't wholly to blame for#55#0 the snafu. The real culprits, they said, are computer makers such as#65#0 IBM that have jumped the gun to unveil 486-based products.`` The reason this is getting so#72#0 much visibility is that some started shipping and#42#0 announced early availability, ''said Hewlett-Packard's Mr. Archuleta.`` You can do that but#28#0 you're taking a risk. Those companies are paying the price for#56#0 taking the risk. ''In late September, IBM began shipping a plug-in card that converts its PS/2 model 70-A21 from a 80386 machine to an 80486 machine. An IBM spokeswoman said the company told customers Monday about the bugs and#43#0 temporarily stopped shipping the product. IBM has no plans to recall its add-on cards, the spokeswoman said, and#44#0 could probably circumvent the bugs without long product delays.`` We don't look at this as#66#0 a major problem for#57#0 us, ''she said. Compaq, which said it discovered the bugs, still#11#0 plans to announce new 486 products on Nov. 6. Because#4#0 of the glitch, however#8#0, the company said it doesn't know when#25#0 its machine will be commercially available. That's a break from Compaq tradition, because#5#Contingency the company doesn't announce products until#12#Temporal they're actually at the dealers. The problem is being ballyhooed, experts say, because#6#Contingency the 486 is Intel's future flagship. Intel's microprocessors are the chips of choice in many of today's personal computers and#45#0 the 80486 microprocessor is the spearhead of the company's bid to guard that spot in the next#22#0 generation of machines.`` Although#1#Comparison these sorts of bugs are not at all uncommon, the 486 is an extremely high-profile product, ''said Mr. Slater, the newsletter editor. Intel's 80486 chip is the Corvette of Intel's microprocessors, a super-fast, super-expensive chip that only the most power-hungry computer users are likely to buy for#58#0 at least several years. Unveiled last April, the chip crams 1.2 million transistors on a sliver of silicon, more than four times as#67#0 many as#68#0 on Intel's earlier#7#0 model, 80386. Intel clocks the chip's speed at 15 million instructions per second, or#73#0 MIPs. That's four times as#69#0 fast as#70#0 the 386. Machines using the 486 are expected to challenge higher-priced work stations and#46#0 minicomputers in applications such as#71#0 so-called servers, which connect groups of computers UCP together, and#47#0 in computer-aided design. But#29#Comparison while#14#0 the chip's speed in processing power is dazzling, it's real strength lies in its software inheritance. The 486 is the descendant of a long series of Intel chips that began dominating the market ever since#15#0 IBM picked the 16-bit 8088 chip for#59#0 its first personal computer. (A 16-bit microprocessor processes 16 pieces of data at a time and#48#0 is slower than newer, 32-bit chips.) Since#16#0 then#18#0, Intel has cornered a large part of the market with successive generations of 16-bit and#49#0 32-bit chips, all of which can run software written for#60#0 previous models. That's what will keep computer makers coming in spite of the irritation of bugs. Big personal computer makers and#50#0 many makers of engineering workstations are developing 486-based machines, which are expected to reach the market early next#23#0 year. Of the big computer makers, only Apple Computer Co. bases its machines on Motorola chips instead#3#Expansion.`` The 486 is going to have a big impact on the industry, ''said Hewlett-Packard's Mr. Archuleta.`` It's going to be the leading edge technology in personal computers for#61#0 the next#24#0 few years. This bug is not going to have any affect on that at all. ''Andy Zipser in Dallas contributed to this article.
