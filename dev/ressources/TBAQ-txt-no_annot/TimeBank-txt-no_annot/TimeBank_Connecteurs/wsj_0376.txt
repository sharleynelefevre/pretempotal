International: X X @ Courtaulds PLC @ Plans to Spin Off @ Textiles Business @-- X X @ By Craig Forman X X @ Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal 10/31/89 WALL STREET JOURNAL (J) COU DIVIDENDS (DIV) STOCK MARKET, OFFERINGS (STK) TEXTILES AND#13#0 APPAREL (TEX) LONDON Courtaulds PLC announced plans to spin off its textiles operations to existing shareholders in a restructuring to boost shareholder value. The British UCP chemical and#14#0 textile company's plan, which requires shareholder approval, would create a new, listed U.K. stock with a probable market capitalization between #300 million ( $  473 million) and#15#0 #400 million, analysts said. The establishment of the separate company, to be called Courtaulds Textiles, could be effective as#23#0 early as#24#0 next#11#0 year's first quarter. Investors welcomed the move. Courtaulds shares rose 15 pence to 362 pence, valuing the entire company at about #1.44 billion. Courtaulds spinoff reflects pressure on British industry to boost share prices beyond the reach of corporate raiders. Courtaulds restructuring is among the largest thus#12#0 far in Britain, though#6#0 it is dwarfed by B.A.T Industries PLC's plans to spin roughly off #4 billion in assets to help fend off a takeover bid from Anglo-French financier Sir James Goldsmith. The divested Courtaulds textile operations had operating profit of #50 million on #980 million in revenue in the year ended March 31. Some analysts have said Courtaulds moves could boost the company's value by 5 % to 10 %, because#3#Contingency the two entities separately#1#0 will carry a higher price earnings multiple than they did combined. In#0#Expansion addition#0#Expansion, Courtaulds said the moves are logical because#4#Contingency they will allow both the chemicals and#16#0 textile businesses to focus more closely on core activities. Courtaulds has been under pressure to enhance shareholder value since#9#0 takeover speculators-- including Australian financier Kerry Packer-- surfaced holding small stakes last year. Though#7#0 Mr. Packer has since#10#0 sold his stake, Courtaulds is moving to keep its institutional shareholders happy. Even without a specific takeover threat, Courtaulds is giving shareholders `` choice and#17#0 value, ''said Julia Blake, an analyst at London stockbrokers Barclays de Zoete Wedd. In a statement, the company said: `` Both parts can only realize their full potential and#18#0 be appropriately valued by the market if#22#0 they are separately#2#0 quoted companies. The sharper definition and#19#0 the autonomy which each will thereby#5#0 gain will benefit shareholders, customers and#20#0 employees. ''Courtaulds Chairman and#21#0 Chief Executive Sir Christopher Hogg will remain in both posts at the surviving chemical company after#8#0 the spinoff.
