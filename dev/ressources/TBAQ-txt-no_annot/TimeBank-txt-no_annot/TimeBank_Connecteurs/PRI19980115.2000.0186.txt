The bonds became worthless when#3#0 the bankrupt thrift was seized by government regulators. Keating's convictions were thrown out in nineteen ninety-six on a technicality. And#6#Expansion on that basis Keating was released from prison before#0#Temporal he was eligible for#8#0 parole. Now the ninth US circuit court of appeals has ruled that the original appeal was flawed since#2#0 it brought up issues that had not been raised before#1#0.
