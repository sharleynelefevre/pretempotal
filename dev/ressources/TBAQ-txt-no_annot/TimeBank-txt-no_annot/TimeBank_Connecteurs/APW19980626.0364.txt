Parliamentary president Rita Suessmuth said the People's Union correctly listed Jacques FW, de Mathan as#10#0 having donated about 274,500 marks in 1995, but#3#0 gave a false address for#6#0 him. German law requires parties to publish the name and#1#0 address of anyone who donates more than 20,000 marks (dlrs 11,000). The anti-foreigner party said it wanted to protect the donor from possible attacks. Suessmuth said, however#0#Comparison, that the law does not allow for#7#0 providing a false address for#8#0 any reason. The fine is twice the donation, as#11#0 provided for#9#0 under German party financing laws. Party spokesman Bernd Droese said the People's Union would challenge the fine in court. The extremist party recently took a surprising 13 percent of the vote in elections in a depressed eastern German state, and#2#0 hopes to win its first seats in the federal parliament this September.
