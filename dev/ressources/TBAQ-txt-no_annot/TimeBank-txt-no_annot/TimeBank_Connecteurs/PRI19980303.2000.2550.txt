In some respects, that's typical county business, but#11#0 tomorrow's vote has international implications. The board will decide whether the Islamic Saudi Academy, funded by the government of Saudi Arabia, can move to Ashburn village, Virginia. But#12#Comparison local residents have not exactly laid out the red carpet for#4#0 their would be neighbors. The World's Nancy Marshalll has our story. Inside the Islamic Saudi academy in Mount Vernon, Virginia, many of the girls wear head scarves and#17#0 some of the neatly dressed children are in uniforms. The instruction is in English for#5#0 most classes, in Arabic for#6#0 language and#18#0 religious studies. The school says it teaches the children to be good Muslims and#19#0 good students. They're learning a civics lesson from the residents of Loudon county. The Islamic Saudi Academy has twelve hundred mostly American students but#13#0 would take thirty-five hundred if#32#0 it had the room. The academy bought a hundred acres in Loudon county, Virginia, and#20#0 asked for#7#0 permission to build a fifty million dollar campus. In the nearby suburban housing tracts, someone dropped off leaflets warning the school could bring thousands of Middle Eastern strangers and#21#0 terrorists. Some residents of the mostly white, mostly middle class area became alarmed. James Zogby of the Arab American Institute says it's a familiar story. There is, X a- at a very deep level in our culture, um I think, a sense of, of ignorance about Islam, a fear about who Muslims are and#22#0 what they're doing. Many local residents denounced the bigotry, but#14#0 opposition to the school then#2#0 shifted. Now critics of the academy are targeting its owner, the Saudi government. Pastor James Allmen of the fellowship church and#23#0 school in Ashburn has led the anti-Saudi campaign. James Allmen says he has no problem with a privately funded academy, but#15#0 he has a big problem with a Saudi funded school. The Saudi Arabian government has an atrocious record on human rights and#24#0 is known to be one of the worst offending countries when#1#0 it comes to religious persecution. That's correct. And#25#Expansion that is a condition of the application, then#3#0. At a public hearing on the Islamic Saudi Academy's application, the split in county opinion was obvious, supporters of the academy, including Ann Robinson, said the Saudis were just providing a service and#26#0 it was unfair to penalize children. We do not further#0#0 the purpose of human rights in the world by violating the human rights under our own constitution. But#16#Comparison opponents said the school might be a target for#8#0 terrorist attacks, complained about its tax exempt status, and#27#0 wondered why the Saudis are not compelled to allow Christians to worship in their country. Virginia Welch delivered this message to the county board of supervisors. I urge you to do the right thing and#28#0 send a message to the Saudis that the citizens of Loudon county embrace religious and#29#0 human freedom. Loudon county officials say they ll rule on the application based only on land use issues and#30#0 ignore all the other objections. What's really behind those objections, some say, is Loudon county's collision with a new reality in America that the country is changing religiously as#33#0 surely as#34#0 it is racially and#31#0 ethnically. According to the Arab American institute, Islam will one day be the second largest religion in the country. For#9#0 an indication of the problems that could face Muslims as#35#0 they integrate into American life, one need look no farther than Loudon county, Virginia. For#10#0 The World, I m Nancy Marshalll.
