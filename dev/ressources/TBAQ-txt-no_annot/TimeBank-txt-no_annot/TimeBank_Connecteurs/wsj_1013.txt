Columbia SampL Posts  $  226.3 Million Loss X @ After#9#Temporal Writing Down High-Yield Portfolio X @-- X @ By Pauline Yoshihashi @ Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal 10/26/89 WALL STREET JOURNAL (J) CSV EARNINGS (ERN) BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. Columbia Savings amp Loan Association, reeling from thrift-accounting changes mandated by Congress and#18#0 the recent collapse of the junk-bond market, announced a loss for#27#0 the third quarter of  $  226.3 million, or#33#0  $  11.57 a share. For#28#0 the quarter a year ago, Columbia reported earnings of  $  16.3 million, or#34#0 37 cents a share. Total assets increased to  $  12.7 billion in the latest quarter from  $  12.4 billion a year earlier#7#0. The loss stems from  $  357.5 million of write-downs on Columbia's  $  4.4 billion high-yield investment securities portfolio, which includes about  $  3.7 billion of junk bonds,  $  400 million of preferred stock, and#19#0 Treasury securities. Columbia owes its spectacular growth in recent years to its junk-bond portfolio, the largest of any U.S. thrift. Much of Columbia's junk-bond trading has been done through the high-yield department of its Beverly Hills neighbor, Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. For#29#0 the nine months, losses totaled  $  212 million, or#35#0  $  10.83 a share, compared with net income of  $  48.7 million, or#36#0  $  1.11 a share, a year earlier#8#0. The results include a  $  130.2 million write-down of the securities in the high-yield portfolio to the lower of their cost or#37#0 market value. Columbia also#13#Expansion added  $  227.3 million to reserves for#30#0 losses on the portfolio, increasing general reserves to  $  300 million, or#38#0 about 6.7 % of the total portfolio, as#41#0 of Sept. 30. On June 30, loss reserves stood at  $  108.3 million. Thrift officials said the  $  300 million reserve will be adjusted quarterly and#20#0 will reflect the rate of dispositions and#21#0 market conditions. The adjustments result from the recently passed thrift-industry bailout legislation, which requires thrifts to divest all high-yield bond investments by 1994. Previously#1#0, Columbia didn't have to adjust the book value of its junk-bond holdings to reflect declines in market prices, because#3#Contingency it held the bonds as#42#0 long-term investments. Because#4#Contingency Columbia now must sell the bonds within five years, accounting rules require the thrift to value the bonds at the lower of cost or#39#0 market prices. For#31#0 its future strategy, Columbia officials said the thrift may branch out into commercial lending or#40#0 managing outside investments, as#6#0 well#6#0 as#43#0 beefing up more traditional thrift activities. The quarterly results also#14#Expansion reflected  $  21.4 million in non-recurring losses from commercial real-estate activities in California. Thomas Spiegel, Columbia's chairman, said in a statement that the thrift was ''disappointed ''by the effects of the accounting changes. But#32#Comparison he said Columbia remains `` one of the most strongly capitalized thrifts in the industry, ''based on the economic value of its NX NX assets and#22#0 NX tangible capital. Columbia announced the results after#10#0 the close of the stock market. Its shares closed at  $  5.125 each in composite New York Stock Exchange trading, down 37.5 cents. The price of Columbia shares has been cut nearly in half since#11#0 August, when#12#0 they traded at about  $  10, as#44#0 investors apparently realized that the thrift would be forced to take a big write-down. The stock's decline accelerated in the past two weeks, from a price of  $  8 a share on Oct. 9. Columbia officials said they don't know how quickly they will dispose of the thrift's junk bonds, because#5#Contingency federal regulations, such as#45#0 those that would allow thrifts to continue holding the bonds in separately#0#0 capitalized subsidiaries, haven't yet#17#0 been completed. Columbia officials also#15#Expansion said the thrift shouldn't face problems meeting regulatory capital requirements, despite the large reserves and#23#0 write-downs and#24#0 stiffer regulatory requirements that should be in place by year's end. Its ratio of tangible equity to total assets as#46#0 of Sept. 30 was 3.6 %, and#25#0 total equity was  $  457.9 million. The thrift emphasized that it has a large portfolio of equity securities issued in connection with corporate restructurings and#26#0 leveraged buy-outs, which has a book value of  $  90 million. Although#2#Comparison many of the transactions related to those securities haven't been completed, Columbia said the ultimate gain on the sale of those assets will range from  $  200 million to  $  300 million. Columbia also#16#Expansion has unrealized gains in its public equity securities portfolio of more than  $  70 million. David B. Hilder in New York contributed to this article.
