''Albright, after#9#0 a 16-hour flight, is scheduled to spend only five hours on the ground in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, her first stop Tuesday morning, and#21#0 then#14#0 about 5, 1/2 hours in Nairobi, Kenya, later#6#0 in the day before#4#Temporal returning immediately home. Albright's visit to East Africa was designed in part to demonstrate U.S. resolve in the face of growing terrorist threats to Americans. Some Kenyans have complained that after#10#0 the Nairobi bombing, rescuers gave priority to finding American victims and#22#0 to protecting evidence at the expense of saving African lives. But#33#Comparison Albright and#23#0 other U.S. officials have strongly disputed that notion, saying the priority had been rescuing all possible, African and#24#0 American. On Friday, when#15#0 Albright set aside vacation plans for#38#0 the hastily planned trip to East Africa, the State Department lifted a warning against travel to Kenya, WP$, whose economy relies heavily on foreign visitors, to further#1#0 ease any strain in the aftermath of the tragedy. Just ahead of Albright's one-day trip, the State Department on Sunday issued an updated `` worldwide caution ''to U.S. travelers in the aftermath of the Aug. 7 bombings at American embassies in Kenya and#25#0 Tanzania and#26#0 because#2#0 of fresh threats to U.S. interests abroad. An accompanying statement specifically#0#0 warned `` against all travel to Pakistan. ''The State Department also#12#Expansion ordered the departure of all non-emergency personnel and#27#0 families of employees from the embassy at Islamabad and#28#0 from U.S. consulates in Karachi, Lahore and#29#0 Peshawar. The warnings came after#11#Temporal Pakistan handed over to Kenyan officials a suspect in the U.S. Embassy bombings, Mohammed Saddiq Odeh, also#13#Expansion known as#39#0 Mohammad Sadiq Howaida and#30#0 Abdull Bast Awadh. The first batch of evidence from the Nairobi bombing arrived over the weekend at the FBI lab at the bureau's Washington headquarters and#31#0 is being analyzed, FBI officials said Monday. Many more shipments are expected, but#34#0 the first batch contained cotton swabs taken at the blast site in hopes of picking up microscopic residues that could positively identify what the bomb was made of. A U.S. official said last week that field tests suggested the presence of a Czech-made plastic explosive called Semtex that has been used by terrorist groups before#5#0.
