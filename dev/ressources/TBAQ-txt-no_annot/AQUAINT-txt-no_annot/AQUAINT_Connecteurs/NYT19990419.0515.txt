Times News Service With the finding of a buried rifle 11 days ago, the authorities in the NAC Buffalo, N.Y., area say they have gathered enough evidence in the October slaying of Dr. Barnett Slepian to begin presenting a murder case to a state grand jury as#23#0 early as#24#0 next#6#0 week. A federal grand jury has already been addressing the slaying under laws that prohibit violence against providers of abortion. Slepian was the mainstay of Buffalo's only abortion clinic before#2#Temporal he was shot to death last Oct. 23 at his home in suburban Amherst. But#17#Comparison the decision by District Attorney Frank C. Clark to begin presenting evidence to a state grand jury suggests that he has amassed enough material to support a criminal indictment for#8#0 homicide.`` We ve gotten to the point where we know what we want to introduce before#3#0 a grand jury, ''Clark said in a telephone interview Monday. Although#0#Comparison the authorities are not saying who the suspect is, all of the attention so#20#0 far has fallen on James C. Kopp, a 44-year-old anti-abortion protester who had been traveling around the country from demonstration to demonstration for#9#0 years. Officially, Kopp is being sought as#25#0 a `` material witness ''in the case. Clark said it was easier to seek extradition of an indicted suspect from another state or#28#0 a foreign country than of someone wanted as#26#0 a material witness. For#10#0 now, though#1#Comparison, that would be a theoretical advantage since#5#0 the authorities have admitted they have no idea where Kopp is. Clark said there was `` no question ''that the finding of the rifle was important in his decision to seek an indictment. The rifle was discovered April 8 buried one foot below the ground, about 200 feet behind Slepian's house. It is undergoing testing at the FBI laboratory in Washington, but#18#0 the authorities have said it resembles the kind of high-powered rifle used in the slaying. Clark said other evidence that prosecutors might present includes a strand of human hair found at the wooded firing site that has a `` high likelihood ''of matching Kopp's hair and#11#0 testimony from a jogger who spotted Kopp's car near Slepian's house at 6 a.m. ten days before#4#0 the shooting. There also#7#Expansion are videotapes of Kopp's car crossing the Canadian border around the days _ in 1994, 1995 and#12#0 1997 _ that three Canadian doctors who perform abortions were shot at. None of those doctors were killed. If#21#0 a suspect is caught and#13#0 charged in UCP both state and#14#0 federal courts, a state trial would likely precede a federal one, giving the authorities two chances to prosecute. New York State double-jeopardy laws would make it difficult to prosecute a suspect who had been found not guilty at a federal trial. U.S. Attorney Denise E. ODonnell declined to discuss what federal charges were being pursued, but#19#0 she said that in a case like this, potential charges would be abortion-related violence, the use of a firearm in an act of violence, crossing state lines to commit a crime, and#15#0, if#22#0 the suspect's act was tied to an organization, violation of the so-called RICO statutes, which prohibit an organized criminal enterprise. Slepian, 52, and#16#Expansion the father of four boys, was shot to death at 10 p.m. as#27#0 he stood chatting with his wife in the kitchen of their home in an affluent enclave in Amherst, which is the largest Buffalo suburb.
