Castro's remarks to a conference of economists were aimed at those who say that Elian should remain in the United States because#3#Contingency his mother sacrificed his life to take her to `` freedom, ''a vision he called a cliche. He placed the blame on Lazaro Rafael Munero, who apparently organized the ill-fated journey on which Elian's mother Elisabeth Brotons and#10#0 10 other people-- including Munero-- died. Castro called Munero-- who reportedly drove a taxi and#11#0 engaged in unofficial businesses in the Cuban city of Cardenas-- a `` ruffian ''on whom Cuban police had amassed `` 100 pages of reports. ''According to sources quoted by the Miami Herald, Munero had fled to Florida in June 1998 and#12#0 returned to Cuba later#6#0 that year, only to be jailed for#30#0 several months.`` The mother was practically kidnapped along with the boy ''to make the late-November trip, Castro said. The Cuban leader said Elian had been especially loved by his parents because#4#Contingency the mother had earlier#1#0 suffered seven miscarriages. Earlier#2#0 Friday, Cuba's communist government celebrated the birth of independence hero Jose Marti on Friday with rallies calling for#31#0 the return of Elian Gonzalez, the `` boy martyr ''at the center of an international custody battle. Tens of thousands of children flooded Havana's Plaza of the Revolution to deliver a dual homage to Marti and#13#0 Elian, the 6-year-old Cuban WP$, whose rescue off Florida's coast two months ago set off a tug-of-war between relatives living on both sides of the Florida Straits. Wearing their red Communist Pioneer neckerchiefs, a string of young boys and#14#0 girls recited poems they wrote for#32#0 Elian, dubbed Cuba's `` boy hero ''and#15#0 `` symbolic child, ''and#16#Expansion for#33#0 Marti, commonly known on the island as#40#0 Cuba's `` teacher ''and#17#0 `` apostle. ''The Communist Party daily Granma compared Elian with revolutionary icon Ernesto `` Che ''Guevara and#18#0 said the boy `` has been converted forever into a symbol of the crimes and#19#0 injustices that imperialism is capable of committing against an innocent. ''The commemorations were similar to those held here annually for#34#0 Marti, the revolutionary and#20#0 poet who fought for#35#0 Cuba's independence from Spain in 1898. But#38#Comparison this year, children wore T-shirts bearing Elian's portrait with their school uniforms. The commemorations began early Friday morning, as#41#0 tens of thousands of Cubans marched through Havana's streets by torchlight. Similar events were held all day in the capital and#21#0 across the island. In Old Havana, hundreds of children marched around the Parque Central chanting `` We will save Elian! ''A small group of girls wore construction paper handcuffs-- an apparent reference to the government's characterization of Elian's retention in the United States as#42#0 a `` kidnapping. ''Fidel Castro's government has been using such traditional political events-- along with other rallies almost every day-- to draw attention to the case of Elian, who was rescued Nov. 25 while#7#0 clinging to an inner tube. His mother and#22#0 10 others died at sea while#8#Comparison trying to reach the United States. For#36#0 the past two months, Elian's father has demanded that the boy be returned to him in Cuba, and#23#0 the U.S. government has said that father and#24#0 son should be reunited. But#39#Comparison Elian's paternal great-uncle in the United States, backed by the anti-Castro Cuban American National Foundation, is fighting in the courts to keep the boy in Miami. Cuba kept up its condemnation of the handling of Wednesday's meeting between Elian and#25#0 his grandmothers at the home of a Roman Catholic nun in Miami Beach, Fla. Sister Jeanne OLaughlin said after#5#0 the meeting she thought Elian should stay in the United States.`` First Fruits of the Monstrousness, ''read the full-page editorial on the front of Friday's edition of the Communist Party daily Granma. It offered more details and#26#0 criticisms of the perceived treatment that Elian's grandmothers, Mariela Quintana and#27#0 Raquel Rodriguez, received from OLaughlin, the Miami relatives and#28#0 other anti-Castro Cubans during the encounter. In an interview with the Spanish language broadcast of CNN, Elian's father also#9#Expansion criticized how the meeting was handled. He repeated charges that his relatives and#29#0 others in Miami had offered him money to stay in the United States with his son.`` They are not going to buy me, ''said Juan Miguel Gonzalez.`` What is important for#37#0 me is that they return the boy to me as#0#0 soon#0#0 as#0#0 possible.
