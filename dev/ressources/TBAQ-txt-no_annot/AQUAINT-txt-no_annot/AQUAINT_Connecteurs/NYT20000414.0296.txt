No Cuban flags sway from its door and#22#Expansion no political signs pushing for#14#0 the case of young Elian Gonzalez hang from its windows. But#12#Comparison the opinion of the woman who runs the modest business, which sells everything from prescription drugs to chewing gum and#23#0 toys, carries a lot of weight in this part of Miami. She is Fidel Castro's younger sister, Juanita. While#4#0 her brother is the personification of evil in this neighborhood where Cuban flags fly from beatup Buicks, Juanita Castro is a beloved and#24#0 respected member of this community.

''`` This has gone too far. And#30#Expansion it's now become a tragedy. ''Dressed in a dark pink blazer and#31#0 cream color pants, the sister of the Cuban dictator walked around the pharmacy talking warmly with her customers. She said she she sometimes talks to family members back in Cuba.`` I have sisters that I still#7#0 speak to, ''she said, `` and#32#0 this situation is driving people crazy. ''The only thing on Cuban television is Elian's story, she said, and#33#0 she feels the Cuban people are getting tired of the issue. She does not speak to her brother and#34#0 hasn't for#18#0 several years.`` Nobody talks to Fidel, because#1#Contingency he doesn't listen, ''Juanita Castro said.`` He talks and#35#0 he decides.

Although#0#Comparison she supports the cause of Miami's Cubans in their struggle against her brother's government, she said she prefers to keep a low profile when#10#0 it comes to politics.`` I just work in my pharmacy every day and#37#0 I pray for#19#0 a resolution in our country (Cuba) that is without violence, ''she said.`` And#38#Expansion I also#11#Expansion pray for#20#0 this young boy every day because#2#Contingency he needs help. He's been through a lot. ''Story Filed By Cox Newspapers For#21#0 NAC Use By Clients of the New York Times News Service NYT-04-14-00 1832EDT &QL;
