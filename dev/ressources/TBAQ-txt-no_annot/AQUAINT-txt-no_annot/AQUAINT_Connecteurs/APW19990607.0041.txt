FBI Director Louis Freeh said the U.S. government is offering a reward of up to  $  5 million for#13#0 information that leads to the arrest and#21#0 conviction of Bin Laden, indicted as#36#0 the architect of the twin bombings of American embassies in Kenya and#22#0 Tanzania. The Aug. 7, 1998, bombings killed more than 200 people, including 12 Americans. It is the largest reward the government has ever offered for#14#0 a fugitive. A total of  $  650,000, meanwhile#2#0, is being offered for#15#0 information leading to the arrest of Kopp, who is charged with gunning down Dr. Barnett Slepian last fall in his home in Buffalo, N.Y. Slepian provided legal abortions in western New York state. The standard  $  50,000 reward for#16#0 information leading to a listed fugitive's capture comes on top of a  $  500,000 reward announced earlier#4#0 by Attorney General Janet Reno, plus#8#0 a  $  100,000 award offered previously#1#0 by the FBI. Reno said Bin Laden and#23#0 Kopp have one thing in common: Each wrongly believes he is justified in using all means possible to achieve his goal. They also#9#Expansion have in common locations unknown to the authorities. Freeh said Bin Laden may be hiding out in Afghanistan, which has been uncooperative in the case. Kopp, meanwhile#3#Temporal, may have approached the border with Mexico, but#10#0 it is unknown whether he crossed into that country, said Freeh. Kopp purports to be a devout Roman Catholic, and#24#0 the majority of jobs he has held over the past 20 years have been related to the anti-abortion movement, the Justice Department said in a news release. State Department international security director Dave Carpenter said that placing Bin Laden on the most-wanted list `` underscores the unwavering commitment ''by the United States `` to fight terrorism. ''The FBI continues to receive threats from individuals and#25#0 organizations with ties to Bin Laden, Freeh said. Carpenter said the U.S. government's counterterrorism program has paid out over  $  6 million in some 20 cases around the world for#17#0 credible information. On the FBI list, Bin Laden and#26#0 Kopp replace two former Libyan intelligence agents charged in the Dec. 21, 1988, bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 that killed 259 people on the plane and#27#0 11 on the ground in Lockerbie, Scotland. The two were removed from the list after#5#Temporal Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi agreed in April to hand them over for#18#0 trial in the Netherlands, a neutral venue. Lamen Khalifa Fhimah and#28#0 Abdel Basset Ali al-Megrahi are charged with murder, conspiracy to commit murder and#29#0 violations of international aviation safety laws. Bin Laden and#30#0 Kopp are the 455th and#31#0 456th persons to be placed on the FBI's most wanted list, which began in 1950. Since#6#0 then#7#0, 427 fugitives have been taken into custody or#35#0 located, 133 of them as#0#0 a#0#0 result#0#0 of citizen assistance, the FBI said. Six suspects in the Bin Laden investigation are known to be in custody in the Metropolitan Correctional Center in New York. Another eight suspects, including Bin Laden, have been charged but#11#0 not apprehended. Another suspect is awaiting extradition from Britain. The FBI says Bin Laden is the leader of a terrorist organization known as#37#0 Al-Aqeda, `` The Base. ''Kopp wears eyeglasses, walks with a slight limp, is 5 feet, 10 inches tall and#32#0 weighs 150 to 175 pounds. Slepian was killed by a single gunshot fired from a wooded area through a window of his home. Prior to the Slepian's shooting, Kopp had traveled the country and#33#0 world, authorities said. He has been arrested more than a dozen times during abortion protests in seven states and#34#0 Italy, but#12#0 has no felony convictions. He has used 29 aliases, Freeh said.
