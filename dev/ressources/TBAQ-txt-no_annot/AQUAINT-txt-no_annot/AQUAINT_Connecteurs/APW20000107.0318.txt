APW20000107.0318 2000-01-07 Cuban Boy's Relatives File Petition APW20000107.0318 NEWS STORY 2000-01-07 22:53 Cuban Boy's Relatives File Petition MIAMI (AP)-- In efforts to prevent Elian Gonzalez's return to Cuba, an anti-Castro lawmaker subpoenaed him Friday to testify before#6#0 a congressional committee and#24#0 one of his Miami relatives sought to become his legal guardian. Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind., said he subpoenaed 6-year-old Elian to testify before#7#0 the Committee on Government Reform on Feb. 10, so#63#0 he remains in the country while#12#0 the courts consider his case. About 100 supporters cheered wildly as#57#0 Elian-- holding the subpoena in front of his face while#13#0 being held aloft by a relative-- appeared outside the house where he has been staying with relatives. He gave the peace sign before#8#Temporal heading back indoors. But#49#Comparison in Cuba, Elian's father was angry about Burton's subpoena.`` What right does that man have? ''Juan Miguel Gonzalez said during a news conference in his hometown of Cardenas.`` I am the father of Elian and#25#0 immigration has said that I am the only one who can speak for#51#0 him `` Why should it be delayed? Who is he? He is no one. I am the father. ''Elian was found Thanksgiving Day clinging to an inner tube at sea after#10#0 his mother, stepfather and#26#0 eight other people drowned while#14#0 trying to reach Florida by boat. The boy was placed with his great-uncle and#27#0 great-aunt in Miami, but#50#0 the Immigration and#28#0 Naturalization Service ruled Wednesday that he must be returned to his father in Cuba by Jan. 14. The decision touched off protests in the Cuban-American community. Burton, the committee's chairman, said in a release he `` issued a subpoena to Elian Gonzalez to ensure that no precipitous action is taken until#16#Temporal the Florida State court in Miami can adequately address the Gonzalez case. ''Burton is an outspoken critic of the Castro regime. A 1996 law named for#52#0 him and#29#0 Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., strengthened the 1959 trade embargo against Cuba. Committee sources who spoke on the condition of anonymity said that while#15#0 the subpoena requires that Elian attend the hearing in Washington, it's highly unlikely that his actual appearance will be sought.`` The Congress of the United States is affording Elian Gonzalez what INS and#30#0 this administration has not, which is his legal right and#31#0 his right to due process, ''said Jorge Mas Santos, chairman of the Cuban American National Foundation.`` This gives him the protection that he will not be repatriated to Cuba between UCP now and#32#0 Feb. 10. ''Earlier#5#0 Friday, lawyers filed a petition on behalf of Elian's great-uncle, Lazaro Gonzalez. It is an attempt by his Miami relatives to get guardianship and#33#0 then#18#0 to file for#53#0 applications for#54#0 admission to the United States and#34#0 asylum, said David Abraham, an immigration law professor at the University of Miami. Neither#3#0 the lawyers nor#3#0 Elian's relatives would comment before#9#0 the judge's ruling, which is expected early next#19#0 week. In Cuba, meanwhile#1#Temporal, tens of thousands of people rallied in a seaside plaza Friday night to demand his return.`` Elian, Cardenas awaits you.. with kisses, ''a Cuban country music band sang. Also#22#Expansion Friday, Miami-Dade Mayor Alex Penelas and#35#0 Miami Mayor Joe Carollo, accompanied by one of the family's lawyers, flew to Washington to appeal directly to Attorney General Janet Reno. Gov. Jeb Bush also#23#Expansion asked President Clinton to reverse the INS order. Reno said she is considering the issues raised in the meeting and#36#0 the state court action.`` I plan to respond as#58#0 quickly as#59#0 possible, ''she said in a statement. Reno has said she was consulted on the INS decision and#37#0 approved of it. Clinton said Friday the INS did the right thing.`` I believe they followed the law, ''Clinton said.`` This is a volatile and#38#0 difficult case.:,.. We need to keep this out of the political process as#60#0 much#4#0 as#4#0 possible. ''In#0#0 contrast#0#0 to Thursday, when#20#0 two Cuban exile leaders and#39#0 133 other people were arrested and#40#0 police were forced to use tear gas to disperse a crowd, protesters in Miami were much calmer Friday. However#2#Comparison, the Cuban exile community called for#55#0 more civil disobedience. About 100 protesters marched in front of the federal building in Orlando on Friday night, waving Cuban and#41#0 American flags and#42#0 chanting `` Cuba libre ''and#43#0 `` long live the USA. ''Two men carried a banner that said `` President Clinton, Please keep Elian in the United States. ''Protesters planned a large demonstration in Little Havana on Saturday and#44#0 were planning to drive around Miami International Airport on Monday.`` If#56#0 the child is sent back to Cuba without his day in court, all hell is going to break loose, ''said Jose Basulto, founder of Brothers to the Rescue, an anti-Castro group. The rally in Cardenas, Cuba, was marked by songs, tears and#45#0 personal recollections of Elian. It was the most personal and#46#0 emotional of many held since#11#0 early December, when#21#0 Cuban President Fidel Castro promised mass mobilization until#17#Temporal the boy was returned to his father. Elian's father, his four grandparents and#47#0 his great-grandmother began weeping as#61#0 they sat in a row of chairs facing the stage as#62#0 the group sang of the boy's mother. Gonzalez looked particularly distraught, his eyes red from crying. During the day Friday, Elian played in his relatives yard with a puppy named Dolphin, a gift from Rep. Lincoln Diaz-Balart, R-Fla. The black Labrador chased Elian around the yard and#48#0 playfully nipped at his blue soccer shorts.`` Elian tells me he does not want to go back to Cuba, ''said Delfin Gonzalez, another of Elian's great-uncles. He said Elian wants his family to come here. AP-NY-01-07-00 2253
