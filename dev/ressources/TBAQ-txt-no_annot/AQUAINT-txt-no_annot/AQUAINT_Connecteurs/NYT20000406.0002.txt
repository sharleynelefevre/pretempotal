Times News Service The New York Times said in an editorial on Thursday, April 6: Juan Miguel Gonzalez has made the right decision to travel to the United States on Thursday to affirm his desire to be reunited with his son, Elian. His presence on American soil is necessary to dispel doubts about his fitness as#35#0 a father _ raised maliciously by Elian's Miami relatives _ and#9#0 to end speculation that he is indifferent about reclaiming custody of his son. With Gonzalez all but#30#0 out of sight in Cuba, the relatives have had a free hand to distort the case with bogus legal arguments and#10#0 unsubstantiated claims that Elian is afraid to see his father. The relatives are obviously fond of Elian, though#2#0 their judgment has clearly been clouded by their animosity toward Fidel Castro, the Cuban leader. Once#7#Temporal Gonzalez comes to the United States _ it would be preferable if#41#0 he went to Miami rather#1#0 than to Washington _ only the most obdurate foes of Castro can argue that Elian should not be reunited with him. Gonzalez's arrival should also#4#Expansion help clear the way for#22#0 the Justice Department to make arrangements to transfer custody of the child. The Miami relatives have left unclear whether they will willingly relinquish custody of Elian, and#11#0 have done their best to stir passions against the Justice Department among Cuban-Americans in South Florida. In hopes of trumping the law, they have unreasonably demanded that a panel of child psychologists determine Elian's fate. The best outcome would be for#23#0 the relatives to turn Elian over to his father as#0#Temporal soon#0#Temporal as#0#Temporal Gonzalez arrives, and#12#0 to do so#34#0 in a spirit of kinship that makes the transition as#36#0 smooth as#37#0 possible for#24#0 Elian. Once#8#Temporal that happens, Gonzalez and#13#0 Elian, though#3#0 technically free to return to Cuba, should remain here to await an appellate court ruling on the case, which is expected next#6#0 month. But#31#Comparison if#42#0 the relatives balk, the Justice Department should quickly revoke their custody of the child and#14#0 obtain a federal court order instructing them and#15#0 their lawyers to turn Elian over to his father. The relatives may be less defiant if#43#0 they are held in contempt of court. If#44#0 a court edict fails to compel compliance, the Justice Department will have to consider sterner measures, for#25#0 the relatives will then#44#0 be resisting the rule of law as#38#0 defined by both the department and#16#0 the courts. But#32#Comparison Washington ought not to rush to take Elian forcibly from the relatives. That course would be psychologically wounding to the boy, and#17#0 could lead to a violent confrontation with demonstrators who gather daily outside the relatives home. The government yields none of its legal or#40#0 moral authority in the case if#45#0 it gives the relatives and#18#0 their supporters time to reflect and#19#0 to look for#26#0 a gentler resolution. As#39#0 a matter of law, compassion and#20#0 common sense, the government is entitled to reunite Elian with his father, and#21#0 it has the power to enforce that right, despite the bluster of Miami's demagogic political leaders. But#33#Comparison for#27#0 now, everyone involved should be searching for#28#0 an amicable ending. Juan Gonzalez is doing his part by making the short journey across the Florida Straits to erase any question about his love for#29#0 his son. (sw) NYT-04-06-00 0010EDT &QL;
