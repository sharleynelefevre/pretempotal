Elian is finally#2#0 getting time to reconnect with his father in a quiet, neutral setting where he is no longer a metaphor for#24#0 the war between the Cubans. A few miles from his temporary home at Andrews Air Force Base, Senator Bob Smith of New Hampshire, Representative Tom DeLay of Texas, both Republicans, and#16#0 the relatives were treating the raid to return Elian as#0#0 though#0#0 it were a Nazi SS operation. Yet#12#Comparison federal agents had a warrant, were enforcing US law, and#17#0 entered the house with the proper force to ensure minimal resistance and#18#0 injury. It was a model of efficient law enforcement, guided by due process. The raid was necessary because#3#Contingency the Gonzalez relatives in Miami, refusing to return the boy, made him into a symbol of resistance to Fidel Castro. Elian printed his name on an application for#25#0 asylum and#19#0 was put in front of a video camera to say that he did not want to go back to Cuba. The relatives treated the boy like a political prop. As#28#0 did Castro, a master manipulator of public opinion in Cuba. Had the relatives allowed Elian to return to Cuba, they would have denied the dictator an opportunity to reenergize support for#26#0 his regime. Juan Miguel Gonzalez apparently is a Castro supporter, but#21#0 that should not disqualify him from being reunited with his child. Ever since#7#0 he first learned that Elian was in Florida last November, he has been persistent in seeking the boy's return. Elian has developed great affection for#27#0 the Miami relatives. It would be ideal if#30#0 they could have returned him to his father yet#13#0 stayed in contact while#8#0 their appeal was pending in court. Negotiations failed, however#1#Comparison, because#4#Contingency they insisted on taking the place of the father, rather#6#0 than being treated as#29#0 concerned, yet#14#0 distant, relatives. Juan and#20#0 Elian Gonzalez will remain in the United States pending the appeal. The father can remain here, but#22#0 he can also#11#Expansion return to Cuba if#31#0 he wishes. Like any other 6-year-old in the care of a loving parent, Elian should go wherever that parent wants. NYT-04-24-00 1856EDT &QL;
