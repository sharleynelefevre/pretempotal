SNIFFEN Associated Press Writer WASHINGTON (AP)-- The Justice Department is reviewing whether alcohol-related driving violations or#48#0 other actions by Elian Gonzalez relatives in Miami warrant moving the 6-year-old boy to a different, temporary custodian.`` That matter is under review, ''Deputy Attorney General Eric Holder said when#16#0 asked Thursday about the violations.`` We will look at that, try to make some kind of factual determination and#18#0 then#14#0 decide what steps, if#50#0 any, need to be taken. ''In#1#Expansion addition#1#Expansion, the department is still#8#0 considering a request last week from Elian's father in Cuba, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, to have Elian's temporary custody shifted from his great-uncle Lazaro Gonzalez to another great-uncle, Manolo Gonzalez. Both great-uncles live in Miami. Juan Miguel Gonzalez objected to the media access to Elian that Lazaro Gonzalez's family has permitted and#19#0 to the treatment of Elian by psychologists selected by Lazaro Gonzalez's family. Meantime#3#0, the possibility of a meeting between Attorney General Janet Reno and#20#0 Lazaro Gonzalez's family reemerged Thursday. Reno agreed to a meeting earlier#5#0 this week, only to have Lazaro Gonzalez's family withdraw the request. But#35#Comparison discussions have been renewed, a Justice official said Thursday. Later#13#0 Thursday, two of Elian's Miami cousins sought support on Capitol Hill for#40#0 legislation that would help keep the boy in America. One of them, Marisleysis Gonzalez, told a news conference that reports of alcohol-related violations by relatives should not have bearing on the custody case.`` We're doing what's in Elian's best interest. My family is a very close family, ''she said. Another cousin, Georgina Cid, said Elian's father had intended to flee Cuba himself, but#36#0 was being coerced by the Castro government to stay and#21#0 make certain statements.`` He wanted to reunite with his son-- but#37#0 not in Cuba, ''Cid said. She said she and#22#0 other family members had spoken to Elian's father by phone both before#0#0 and#0#0 after#0#0 the mother perished. The father's response when#17#Contingency learning that his boy was safe in Miami was `` take care of him until#7#Temporal I can go, meaning go to the United States, ''Cid said. A group of Florida lawmakers introduced legislation this month to grant Elian American citizenship, which would take the decision about Elian's future away from INS and#23#0 give it to a Florida family court. Support for#41#0 the bill has been waning. Reno has already met with Lazaro Gonzalez's lawyer and#24#0 a Catholic nun from Miami who oppose his return to Cuba, as#4#0 well#4#0 as#49#0 with Elian's two grandmothers from Cuba, who want him returned. In Havana, Elian's father joined President Fidel Castro on Thursday in a packed auditorium in what has become a daily public rally to press for#42#0 the boy's return. Speaker after#11#0 speaker denounced the United States and#25#0 extolled the virtues of Cuba's communist revolution. A Justice official, who requested anonymity, said the department has authority, if#51#0 necessary, to shift temporary custody to someone other than Lazaro Gonzalez. The boy was placed in his care after#12#0 being found clinging to an inner tube in the Atlantic last Thanksgiving following a boat wreck that killed his mother and#26#0 10 other people. The Immigration and#27#0 Naturalization Service has ruled in favor of the father's request that the boy be returned to him in Cuba, but#38#0 that decision was put on hold while#10#0 the Miami relatives battle in federal court to keep him in this country. Holder said that INS acted appropriately but#39#0 `` now#2#0 that#2#0 we have this new information, we ll have to look at it, and#28#0 see, like I said, what steps if#52#0 any are appropriate. ''Florida state records show Lazaro Gonzalez, 49, was found guilty of driving under the influence of alcohol at least twice from 1991 to 1997. Records also#15#Expansion show Lazaro Gonzalez's 62-year-old brother, Delfin Gonzalez, has been found guilty at least twice of driving under the influence. On Wednesday, Ricardo Alarcon, head of Cuba's National Assembly and#29#0 Castro's key man for#43#0 U.S.-Cuban relations, said the convictions prove the homes of those uncles are no place for#44#0 Elian.`` Practically everyone surrounding him either#6#0 has been, or#6#0 may be in the future, joining the prison system in the U.S. That's not the best interest of the child, ''Alarcon told reporters in Havana. He said Elian was `` surrounded by two drunks. ''Armando Gutierrez, a spokesman for#45#0 the Miami relatives, dismissed the criticism: `` Elian is surrounded by love. ''Elian's relatives and#30#0 other Miami supporters say his mother died to give him freedom. The newspaper of Cuba's Communist Party, daily Gramma, published a letter Thursday from Elian's grandmothers to Reno and#31#0 Immigration and#32#0 Naturalization Service Commissioner Doris Meissner asking for#46#0 Elian's return.`` No material good exists that can compete with the value of the family, and#33#0 it is humiliating for#47#0 us that people are still#9#0 questioning our love and#34#0 the future that awaits Elian at his home, ''said a Spanish version of the letter, dated Feb. 4.
