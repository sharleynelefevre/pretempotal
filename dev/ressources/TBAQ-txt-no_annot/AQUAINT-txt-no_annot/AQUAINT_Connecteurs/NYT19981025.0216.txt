Additional details of the slaying emerged on Sunday. Slepian's lawyer, Glenn Edward Murray, said the sniper's bullet entered through a partially draped kitchen window, hit Slepian in the back and#11#0 exited through his chest. The doctor's wife and#12#0 one of his sons were in the kitchen when#6#0 the shooting occurred, Murray said. The bullet bounced off a cabinet and#13#0 ricocheted into the living room, where the doctor's three other children were watching television, Murray said. Slepian's wife and#14#0 one son tried to revive him. Just over an hour later#3#0, he was declared dead at nearby Millard Fillmore Suburban Hospital. For#8#0 the most part, people on both sides of the abortion issue expressed outrage at the shooting. But#23#0 one abortionopponent, the Rev. Donald Spitz, the founder of Pro-Life Virginia, described Slepian's killer as#27#0 a `` hero ''for#9#0 ending the physician's `` bloodthirsty practice. ''`` We as#28#0 Christians have a responsibility to protect the innocent from being murdered, ''Spitz said in a statement released to The Associated Press, `` the same way we would want someone to protect us. Whoever shot the shot protected the children. ''Most other opponents of abortion, however#0#0, condemned the shooting and#15#0 abortion. In his Sunday Mass at St. Patrick's Cathedral in New York, Cardinal John OConnor called the murder wrong but#24#0 he urged those angered by the slaying to be equally angered by abortions.`` He called on many of the same people to express outrage at partial birth abortion, which he called the equivalent of infanticide, ''Joseph Zwilling, a spokesman for#10#0 the Archdiocese of New York, said of the cardinal's sermon. Religious leaders in Buffalo also#5#Expansion condemned the shooting. Bishop Henry Mansell of the Archdiocese of Buffalo said it was `` an act of madness, ''but#25#0 he went on to defend the Church's opposition to abortion as#29#0 `` respecting of human life in all its forms, especially the most vulnerable. ''Susan Dudley, deputy director of the National Abortion Federation, assailed the remarks and#16#0 called on anti-abortion groups to shift their tactics. She said the rhetoric of the anti-abortion movement has helped lead to violent attacks against abortion providers.`` I think that when#7#Contingency pro-life organizations try to distinguish between themselves and#17#0 these incidents they are at best being disingenuous, ''she said.`` They are the ones who call these doctors murderers. ''In Amherst, residents who said they opposed abortion decried the attack and#18#0 said they hoped the perpetrator was caught. Men smoking cigars and#19#0 drinking beer with friends after#2#Temporal shooting skeet at the Buffalo Shooting Club in Amherst said their feelings about abortion were mixed, but#26#0 they uniformly denounced the killing of Slepian. Many residents said abortion had gradually dwindled as#30#0 a local issue since#1#0 Operation Rescue, an anti-abortion group, started a series of largely unsuccessful `` Spring of Life ''demonstrations in 1992 intended to shut down abortion clinics and#20#0 harass local doctors, including Slepian. Little of the vitriol that the issue aroused in the late 1980s and#21#0 early 1990s remains, residents said, and#22#0 many of the local religious leaders who led the 1992 protests have moved.`` The only people that are left are the hard-core, fanatical people, ''said Larry Finkelstien, a high school teacher who works as#31#0 an escort at abortion clinics.`` Everyone else#4#0 has gone away.
