Elian could be forced to stay longer if#63#Contingency the Miami relatives who are seeking asylum for#36#0 the child over his Cuban father's objections pursue further#0#0 appeals. Attorney Kendall Coffey said his clients were giving an appeal to the Supreme Court `` serious consideration. ''The Miami relatives could also#22#Expansion request a rehearing before#6#0 the same three-judge panel that issued Thursday's ruling, or#69#0 before#7#0 the entire 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeal. But#26#Comparison Thursday's decision made it clear the family has only 14 days to decide whether to request a rehearing at that level. &UR; &LR; `` Expect no extensions, ''the court instructed. The ruling follows six months of international family infighting, political recriminations and#43#0 wide-spread protests in both Miami and#44#0 Cuba over the fate of the 6-year-old boy. His mother died trying to smuggle Elian out of Cuba, and#45#0 it has been difficult for#37#0 family members, Miami community leaders and#46#0 many politicians to separate attitudes about Cuban leader Fidel Castro from the legal issues involved. The appellate ruling made it clear the court takes no joy in lifting an obstacle to Elian's return to Cuba.`` We acknowledge, as#65#0 a widely accepted truth, that Cuba does violate human rights and#47#0 fundamental freedoms and#48#0 does not guarantee the rule of law to people living in Cuba, ''wrote Judge J.L. Edmonson, on behalf of the panel. But#27#Comparison the Immigration and#49#0 Naturalization Service's decision to deny Elian an asylum hearing was `` within the outside border of reasonable choices, ''the opinion read.`` The court neither#4#0 approves nor#4#0 disapproves the INS decision to reject the asylum applications filed on plaintiff's behalf, but#28#0 the INS decision did not contradict (federal law.) ''The judges denied, however#1#Comparison, a request by Elian's father to name him instead#5#0 of great-uncle Lazaro Gonzalez as#66#0 Elian's representative in the continued court proceedings. Making Juan Miguel Gonzalez his son's legal representative would have allowed him to simply drop the asylum request and#50#0 head for#38#0 home. Elian's great-uncle vowed to continue the battle, and#51#0 said the Miami relatives might sue for#39#0 visitation while#17#0 the child is in the United States.`` We will keep fighting with the laws.. so#68#0 Elian Gonzalez can live in a free country like his mother wanted, ''Lazaro Gonzalez said. President Clinton and#52#0 Attorney General Janet Reno praised the ruling, with both stressing their confidence that Juan Miguel Gonzalez is the best person to raise his child. &UR; &LR; `` As#67#0 I ve said before#8#0, this is a case about the importance of family and#53#0 the bond between a father and#54#0 son, ''Clinton said in a written statement issued from Berlin. Elian's father asked his Miami relatives to end their court battle after#14#0 Thursday's ruling and#55#0 allow him to finally#3#0 return home with his son.`` A child should simply be with his parents, always his parents, ''the elder Gonzalez said through an interpreter. Switching to English, he said, `` I want to thank the American people. Thank you. ''Elian was rescued off the coast of Florida by two American fishermen last November after#15#0 the boat he was in capsized. Elian's mother and#56#0 10 others died, but#29#0 the boy survived by clinging to an inner tube. Elian's Miami relatives took in the child, but#30#0 then#25#0 refused to return him to his surviving father in Cuba, citing the harshness of the Castro regime. The Miami relatives applied for#40#0 political asylum on Elian's behalf, saying the child did not want to return to Cuba. INS agents traveled to Cuba to interview the child's father before#9#Temporal the INS rejected the application for#41#0 asylum, saying the child's father was the only person authorized to represent him. A district court judge upheld the federal agency. The Miami relatives appealed that decision, and#57#0 obtained an injunction requiring Elian to remain in the United States until#11#Temporal the asylum question worked its way through the courts. Juan Miguel Gonzalez arrived in the United States April 2, and#58#0 Reno ordered the Miami relatives to surrender the child to his father. The family refused, and#59#0 federal agents took the child by force in a pre-dawn raid on the Miami relatives home on April 22. The father and#60#0 his son lived for#42#0 a month on a large, private estate in Maryland, but#31#0 have recently moved to an affluent neighborhood in Washington, D.C., to wait out the rest of their time in the United States. Shortly after#16#0 the appellate panel released its decision, attorney Coffey filed an emergency request to Supreme Court Justice Anthony M. Kennedy (who has jurisdiction over such matters from Florida) requesting assurance that Elian will remain in the United States until#12#Temporal the full Supreme Court can consider a formal appeal. But#32#Comparison Reno said the request to Kennedy serves no purpose since#21#0 the injunction blocking Elian's return to Cuba still#19#0 applies. If#64#0 the family fails to file an appeal within 14 days, she said, the soonest Elian would be free to leave the country would be seven days later#18#Temporal. However#2#Comparison, Justice Department officials said the appellate court could decide to waive the extra seven-day period. Protesters were beginning to gather outside the Miami relatives home even before#10#0 the ruling was issued. They yelled and#61#Expansion wept when#23#0 the decision was announced. In a statement read on Cuban television, Castro's government expressed its displeasure at still#20#0 another delay in Elian's return. The government called the 14-day waiting period `` another concession to the ` mafia "", _ a disparaging term the government frequently uses to describe Miami's exile Cuban community. Jose Basulto, founder of Brothers to the Rescue, a Cuban exile group that frequently rescues Cuban refugees from the Straits of Florida, called the latest ruling `` outrageous. ''`` The saga of Elian Gonzalez is a turning point in relations in the Cuban community and#62#0 the United States, ''Basulto said.`` This day, in the history of their relations with the United States, will be remembered in the Cuban community in the same way the Bay of Pigs is remembered. ''Cuban exiles failed to overthrow Castro in 1961 when#24#0 the communist leader repelled their invasion at the Bay of Pigs. END OF STORY NYT-06-01-00 2301EDT &QL;
