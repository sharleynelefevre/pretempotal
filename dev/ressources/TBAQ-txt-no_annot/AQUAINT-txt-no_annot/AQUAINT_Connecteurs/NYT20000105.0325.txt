Faced with the choice of keeping Elian Gonzalez with relatives in Miami, where the boy has been wooed with American toys and#10#0 theme-park visits, or#55#0 returning him to his apparently distraught father in Havana, the Immigration and#11#0 Naturalization Service decided the boy should go home by Jan. 14, INS commissioner Doris Meissner told reporters.`` This little boy, who has been through so#52#0 much, belongs with his father, ''Meissner told a news conference.`` The core issue here is the bond between the parent and#12#0 the child. ''The decision was met with outrage by Cuban-Americans, who said the youngster will suffer under the repressive communist regime of Fidel Castro. Lawyers for#37#0 the boy's family in Miami sent letters of protest to Attorney General Janet Reno and#13#0 President Clinton and#14#0 said they were prepared to file a court appeal if#46#0 Reno and#15#0 Clinton spurn the Gonzalez family. Anti-Castro demonstrators thronged the street near the local INS office in Miami Wednesday, demanding that Elian be allowed to stay.`` Today is a sad day for#38#0 the US Constitution.. and#16#Expansion for#39#0 the hopes and#17#0 dreams of Elian's mother Elizabeth, ''who died with nine other adults when#7#0 their boat sank as#51#0 they attempted to reach Florida, said Roger Bernstein, representing the Miami Gonzalez family.`` Nobody wants the boy to be separated from his father, ''said Ninoska Perez of the Miami-based Cuban-American National Foundation.`` But#29#Comparison that little boy, by surviving two days on an inner tube, has earned the right to stay here in freedom. ''In Havana, the government gave a guarded first response to the INS ruling, warning against `` excessive optimism ''and#18#0 predicting `` the Cuban-American mafia and#19#0 the extreme right in the U.S. Congress ''would still#4#0 put up a fight to keep the boy. Meissner said the INS decision was made after#3#Temporal two lengthy interviews with the boy's father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, a hotel worker in Cardenas, Cuba, who Meissner said is anxious to have Elian returned to him. Since#6#0 the boy is so#53#0 young, Meissner said, the natural father has the right to speak for#40#0 Elian. There is `` no information ''that Gonzalez, who was divorced from Elian's mother, is UCP an unfit father, nor#32#0 that he has been coerced by the Castro regime into pleading for#41#0 his son's return, Meissner said. Spencer Eig, an attorney for#42#0 the Gonzalez family in Miami, said Meissner's assumptions were `` unconstitutional and#20#0 untrue. ''`` Elian can not apply for#43#0 asylum from persecution by the Fidel Castro government, ''Eig complained.`` If#47#Contingency only his father, who is under the control of the Fidel Castro regime, can do it for#44#0 him.. that is deeply unfair and#21#0 untrue. ''Meissner gave no reason for#45#0 the Jan. 14 deadline, and#22#0 it is still#5#0 unclear how Elian would be transported back to Cuba if#48#0 the Gonzalez family's appeals are unsuccessful. The INS offered three options: that Gonzalez come to pick up his son, that the family in Miami take him to Cuba, or#56#0 that a `` third party ''escort the child to his homeland. Gonzalez _ perhaps under duress from the Castro regime _ has indicated he does not want to travel to Miami, and#23#0 there is `` no way ''the Miami Gonzalezes will assist in sending Elian back to Cuba, Perez said. Having a third party escort Elian frees the INS from the politically uncomfortable spectacle of having to do the task itself. The Cuban-American lobby is a locally powerful political force few politicians want to provoke. Clinton has sought to distance himself from the controversy from the start.`` I told you when#8#0 we started this I would do my best to keep the decision out of politics, ''Clinton told reporters in the Rose Garden Wednesday.`` We have done that. ''But#30#Comparison if#49#0 Elian is forced to go back to Cuba, `` the Clinton-Gore administration, specifically#0#0 (Vice President) Al Gore, will pay a high price in terms of votes in Florida, ''Perez said. Cuba experts and#24#0 child custody lawyers said the INS ruling was appropriate under the law.`` It's high time ''the boy was sent back to his birthplace, said Wayne Smith, a former Clinton administration adviser on Cuba.`` This was a simple child custody case. ''`` Every state court and#25#0 every family court in the United States would award custody to a surviving parent rather#2#0 than a distant relative who lives a more prosperous life, ''said David Abraham, a professor at Miami Law School and#26#0 expert in custody law.`` We may have the Disneylands and#27#0 the Universal Studios and#28#Expansion all the things that were dangled before#1#0 the little boy's eyes, ''Abraham added.`` But#31#Comparison that's his home. ''With the political implications so#54#0 strong, it's unlikely the case of Elian Gonzalez will be closed quickly, said Richard Nuccio, a former Clinton administration Cuba adviser.`` With two members of Congress representing Elian's family's constituency, I don't see how Elian could be returned by the federal government without it going through the court system, ''Nuccio said.
