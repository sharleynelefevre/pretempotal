Times News Service Federal law enforcement officials said Wednesday that they had concluded that James Kopp, an impassioned and#12#0 nomadic opponent of abortion, fired the shots that killed a NAC Buffalo, N.Y., abortion-clinic doctor last October. Based on physical evidence _ including a rifle found in April month buried near the doctor's house and#13#0 a match between fibers found near the murder and#14#0 others found in Kopp's car _ officials said they had decided to issue a warrant for#28#0 his arrest in the killing of Dr. Barnett Slepian. Kopp, a fugitive, has until#5#0 now been described only as#34#0 a material witness and#15#0 a nationwide warrant had been issued so#1#0 that#1#0 he could be held for#29#0 questioning. There was no official confirmation of the decision to upgrade the warrant, but#10#0 Denise ODonnell, the U.S. attorney for#30#0 the Western District of New York in Buffalo, has scheduled a news conference Thursday to announce a `` major development ''in the Slepian murder investigation. Erie County District Attorney Frank Clark, Bernard Tolbert, the special FBI agent in charge of the Buffalo office, and#16#0 other investigators will also#6#Expansion be there. Since#4#0 there is no federal homicide statute as#35#0 such, the federal officials said Kopp could be charged under the recent Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act, which provides for#31#0 a sentence of up to life imprisonment for#32#0 someone convicted of physical assaults or#40#0 threats against abortion providers. If#39#0 Kopp were also#7#Expansion indicted and#17#0 convicted on state murder charges, he could face the death penalty. Slepian, a 52-year-old obstetrician and#18#0 gynecologist who was the mainstay of Buffalo's only abortion clinic, was shot to death on the night of Oct. 23 as#36#0 he stood in the kitchen of his home in suburban Amherst, N.Y. chatting with his wife and#19#0 one of his four sons. No weapon was recovered in the first police searches of the area around Slepian's home. But#11#Comparison on April 8, investigators, wondering how the assailant could have emerged from the woods without fearing he would be seen carrying a rifle, searched the site of the shooting once#9#0 more and#20#0 unearthed a rifle buried one foot below ground 200 feet behind the Slepian home. Clark, the Erie district attorney, said afterwards#0#0 that investigators think the doctor's killer buried the rifle in the days before#2#0 the shooting, unearthed the weapon to fire the fatal shots, then#8#0 hurriedly reburied it and#21#0 fled. The 44-year-old Kopp, who in FBI photographs appears as#37#0 gaunt and#22#0 scruffily bearded and#23#0 WP$, whose last known addresses were in Vermont and#24#0 New Jersey, emerged as#38#0 the focus of the investigation within two weeks of the slaying. A jogger observed Kopp's car at 6 a.m. near Slepian's home 10 days before#3#0 the murder, and#25#0, curious why a stranger would be parked there so#33#0 early, wrote down the license plate number.
