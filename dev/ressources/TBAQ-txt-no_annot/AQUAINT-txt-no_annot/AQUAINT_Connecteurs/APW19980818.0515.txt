Changes dateline, byline. &QL; &UR; AP Photos &QL; &UR; By DAVE CARPENTER &QC; &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright paid tribute Tuesday to bombing victims and#30#0 embassy staffers on a whirlwind visit to East Africa, and#31#0 promised to track down the perpetrators.`` Together, we promise to bring to justice the murderers of our friends, ''she told American and#32#0 Tanzanian workers at the bomb-hit U.S. Embassy in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. Officials in Tanzania and#33#0 Kenya, where she arrived next#12#0, also#16#Expansion hoped she would produce new aid for#23#0 their countries, where the Aug. 7 terrorist blasts killed 257 people in Nairobi and#34#0 Dar es Salaam. FBI agents, meanwhile#1#Temporal, pushed ahead with their all-out investigation into the bombings. Contrary to other reports, the FBI and#35#0 Kenyan police said Monday that a suspect who was returned from Pakistan had not admitted any role in the crimes or#53#0 implicated anyone else#15#0 after#6#0 three days of questioning. Albright, arriving after#7#0 a 16-hour flight, spent about five hours in Tanzania before#3#Temporal heading to Nairobi in a small plane when#14#0 an engine of the Boeing 747 she had flown in from Washington overheated. She was scheduled to lay flowers at the bombed embassy, talk to Kenyan embassy guards and#36#0 others who survived the blast and#37#0 meet with President Daniel arap Moi in a five-hour visit before#4#Temporal returning home. In Dar es Salaam, she laid a wreath next#13#0 to the crater left by the embassy blast that killed 10 people. Then#10#Temporal she handed a folded American flag to U.S. Marines and#38#0, wearing a white construction hard hat, toured the damage inside. Reporters also#17#Expansion were allowed inside for#24#0 the first time since#8#0 the explosion and#39#0 found broken glass and#40#0 smashed furniture scattered throughout the embassy. Albright helped hang a poster advertising a reward of up to dlrs 2 million for#25#0 information leading to the bombers arrest. She then#11#0 lavished praise, and#41#0 the State Department's award for#26#0 heroism, on embassy staffers before#5#Temporal meeting with bombing victims at the Muhimbili Medical Center and#42#0 with government officials.`` America is very proud of you, all of you _ Americans and#43#0 Tanzanians, ''she told the staffers.`` I am truly in the presence of heroes. ''Albright announced a gift of 500 pounds (225 kilograms) of medical supplies to Tanzania and#44#0 Kenya from the Walter Reed Army Medical Center. She also#18#Expansion pledged to ask Congress to approve a still-undetermined amount of emergency funding to pay for#27#0 re-establishing embassy operations in Tanzania and#45#0 Kenya and#46#0 to compensate victims families. Officials in the two African countries are counting on substantial compensation along with assurances of aid for#28#0 the governments, WP$, whose key tourism industries were dealt a blow by the bombings. But#21#Comparison Tanzanian Foreign Minister Jakaya Kikwete, speaking at a joint news conference with Albright, said there are no ill feelings in Tanzania toward Americans because#2#0 of their handling of the rescue, as#56#0 there are among some Kenyans.`` The bomb blast has not generated any hatred against.. Americans in Tanzania, ''he said.`` We are friends. ''He also#19#Expansion urged Albright to tell Americans that Tanzania is safe and#47#0 they should continue visiting and#48#0 investing in the country. Albright told the foreign minister the American people share in the profound sorrow of the Tanzanians and#49#0 said the United States will maintain its presence throughout Africa and#50#0 throughout the world.`` These bombings will not cause America to back down or#54#0 retreat, ''she declared. The head of the FBI investigation in Dar es Salaam, Kenneth Piernick, said the bureau has questioned more than 100 people there, but#22#0 indicated that most of the interrogations had led nowhere.`` Right now my evidence is scant, and#51#0 I m not going to draw conclusions based on that, ''he said. He would not elaborate, or#55#0 comment on whether two suspects remained in detention, as#57#0 was previously#0#0 reported. In Nairobi, a top Kenyan police official denied a newspaper report that more arrests had been made there. Officials said last week that six people were in custody for#29#0 questioning about the bombing. About 200 Americans _ nonessential U.S. Embassy staff and#52#0 their families _ left Pakistan today on orders from Washington following a `` pattern of threats ''against Americans there since#9#0 the Africa bombings. The diplomats were flown to Brussels, Belgium. Other Americans have also#20#Expansion been urged to leave.
