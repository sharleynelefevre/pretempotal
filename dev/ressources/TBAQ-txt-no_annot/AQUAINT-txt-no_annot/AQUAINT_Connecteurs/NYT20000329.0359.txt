Times News Service MIAMI _ Elected officials in and#10#0 around Miami warned U.S. immigration officials Wednesday that they should expect little help from the police here when#4#0 they come for#7#0 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez, and#11#0 they said this city could erupt in violence if#21#0 federal agents tried to forcibly take the boy from his great-uncle's house in Little Havana and#12#0 send him back to Cuba.`` We will not lend our respective resources, whether they be in the form of police officers or#28#0 any other resources, to assist the federal government in any way, shape or#29#0 form to inappropriately repatriate Elian Gonzalez to Cuba, ''said Alex Penelas, mayor of Miami-Dade County. As#25#0 of Wednesday evening, Lazaro Gonzalez, the boy's great-uncle and#13#0 temporary guardian, still#1#0 had not signed an agreement to hand the child over to immigration officials if#22#0 the Miami relatives lose a fight to keep him when#5#0 the case is heard in May in the 11th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals.`` I won't cooperate in anything, ''Gonzalez told a Spanish-language television station.`` The boy lives in my house, and#14#0 they ll have to go find him there. ''As#26#0 pressure built in this city, the home of a large number of Cuban exiles, officials of the Immigration and#15#0 Naturalization Service said they did not plan to remove Elian on Thursday morning even if#23#0 his Miami relatives continued to defy them. But#6#Comparison an INS spokeswoman said the agency would revoke Elian's permission to stay in the United States, clearing the way for#8#0 his return to Cuba. In Havana, Cuban President Fidel Castro said that the boy's father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, would travel to the United States to bring his son home after#2#Temporal the custody battle has been decided in the courts. Elian's father would be accompanied by other family members from Cuba, some of the boy's former classmates and#16#0 teachers, and#17#0 psychiatric experts, Castro said on Cuban television.`` We have the perfect formula for#9#0 reinserting Elian, ''Castro said. He also#3#Expansion said that the group would be willing to wait as#0#0 long#0#0 as#0#0 it takes to bring the boy back. Asked to comment on Castro's announcement, a Justice Department spokesman said: `` Certainly it changes things. How it changes things is a little hard to say at this point. If#24#0 the father shows up in Miami and#18#0 decides to go and#19#0 ring the doorbell of his relatives and#20#0 find his son, well, the family in Miami is on record as#27#0 saying they would turn over Elian to him. Whether they actually do this remains to be seen. ''NYT-03-29-00 2125EST &QL;
