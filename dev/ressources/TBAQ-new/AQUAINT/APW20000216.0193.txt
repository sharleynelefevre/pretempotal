Elian's Father Wants Update on Son

HAVANA (AP ) --

Elian Gonzalez's father said#e1 in a letter published#e2 Wednesday#t1 that he wants#e3 Cuban diplomats based in Washington to meet#e5 with his 6-year-old son in Miami and check#e54 on his condition.

``We are worried not only about his prolonged kidnapping#e55,'' Juan Miguel Gonzalez wrote#e6 in a letter published#e7 on the front page of the Communist Party daily#t2 Granma. ``We lack#e8 direct information about the concrete conditions to which he is subjected#e9 in his daily#t3 life.''

There was no immediate response#e56 from the U.S. government to the request#e57. It was likely to be opposed#e10 by Elian's Miami relatives, who are fighting#e11 to keep#e12 the boy in the United States and who have said#e13 they think#e14 Gonzalez is being controlled by Fidel Castro's government.

Gonzalez also wrote#e16 to Attorney General Janet Reno earlier this#t4>week#t4,demanding#e17 that Elian be returned#e18 to him and saying#e19 he does not recognize#e77 the courts hearing#e74 the custody battle#e59. The Justice Department said#e21 it was reviewing#e22 that letter.

Gonzalez's second letter to Reno in two#t5>weeks#t5 was published#e23 in Granma on#s2 Tuesday#t6.

``I formally object#e24 to the legal moves#e60 made or being made by those who are arbitrarily retaining#e27 Elian,'' Gonzalez said#e28 in the letter, dated#e29 Monday#t7.

In the letter, Gonzalez said#e30 he does not recognize#e75 the jurisdiction of theU.S. court system, which is weighing an attempt#e62 by Elian's Miami relatives to block#e31 his return#e63 to Cuba.

Elian has been the focus of an international custody battle#e65 since he was found#e32 on an inner tube off the Florida coast on#s1 Nov.#t8>25#t8. The boy's mother and 10 other people died when their boat sank#e33 on the way from Cuba to the UnitedStates.

Elian is staying with his paternal great-uncle Lazaro Gonzalez, who is fighting#e35 to keep#e36 the boy with him in the United States. Cuban exiles in Miami say#e37 the boy's mother died#e76 to give#e38 him freedom in the United States, while theCuban government maintains#e39 Elian is being improperly kept from his father.

``Juan Miguel must not have written#e41 the letter himself,'' said#e42 Armando Gutierrez, spokesman for Elian's relatives in Miami. ``Castro must be dreaming#e43 for the family to allow#e44 Cuban spies inside Lazaro Gonzalez's home.''

Lawyers for the relatives in Miami filed#e45 a brief in federal court on#s3 Monday#t9 arguing#e46 the Immigration and Naturalization Service cannot return#e47 Elian to Cuba without holding#e48 a political asylum hearing#e70.

U.S. government lawyers have moved#e49 to dismiss#e50 the Miami relatives' lawsuit,arguing#e51 that they have no legal standing in the boy's case. The INS ruled#e52 last#t10>month#t10 that only Elian's father has the right to speak#e53 for the boy in immigration matters.
