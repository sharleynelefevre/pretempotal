DAR ES SALAAM, Tanzania (AP) _

The bomb outside the U.S. Embassy in Tanzania was so powerful that it shook#e1 furniture in homes a mile away.

But the solid construction of the Israeli-built embassy may have prevented#e3 the carnage of a similar bomb in Kenya, an official said#e4 Saturday#t1.

Another reason was the location _ a quiet tree-lined neighborhood.

The embassy away from the center of Dar es Salaam, Tanzania's laid-back capital of swaying#e7 palms and sparse traffic, is largely free from the congestion that plagues#e8 most other major African cities.
