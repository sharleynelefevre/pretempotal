Abortion Rights Doctor Remembered



BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) --

About 500 people attended#e1 a Sunday#t2 night memorial service#e2 for the Buffalo-area physician who performed#e3 abortions, one#t3>year#t3 after#s1 he was killed#e4 by a sniper's bullet.

A nurse who was critically injured#e5 in the 1998#t4 abortion clinic bombing#e6 in Birmingham, Ala., was among#e7 those who attended#e8 the interfaith ceremony#e9 at a Presbyterian church for Dr. Barnett Slepian.

Police kept watch#e10 outside and about 25 undercover police were scattered#e11 throughout the crowd.

``Security is#e12 tight,'' said#e13 Marilynn Buckham, of Buffalo Gyn Womanservices, a sponsor of the ceremony#e14. ``But it's not tonight#t5 we're worried#e16 about. It's all of the other dark nights.''

A memorial service#e20 planned#e17 at the University of Rochester for#s2 Saturday#t6 was canceled#e18 after#s3 security plans were leaked#e19.

Slepian was killed#e21 on#s4 Oct.#t7>23#t7>1999#t7 by a sniper hiding#e22 in his backyard. Earlier#t8>that#t8>day#t8, the Slepian family sent#e23 a fax#e24 to local police explaining#e25 that abortion providers were warned#e26 that one of them might be targeted#e27 for assassination#e28.

On#s7 May#t9>6#t9, James Kopp, 44, was charged#e29 with the slaying#e30. Kopp remains#e31 at-large and police admit#e32 that despite a worldwide search#e33 and a $1 million reward, they don't know#e34 where he is#e35.

``It's very frustrating#e39 knowing#e36 that he's out#e37 there,'' said#e38 Ms. Buckham. ``It's very scary#e40.''

Sunday#t10's yahrtzeit service#e41 ---- a Jewish ceremony#e42 that commemorates#e43 the dead with the lighting#e44 of a 24-hour candle ---- included#e45 the lighting#e46 of candles for the seven people killed#e47 and 12 people injured#e48 in abortion-related violence#e49 since#s5 1993#t11.

A tearful audience also listened#e50 to registered nurse Emily Lyons, who has undergone#e51 a number of operations#e52 since#s6 the Alabama clinic bombing#e53 and has#e54 permanently damaged eyesight. She spoke#e55 of Slepian and other abortion providers who have been killed#e56.

``They paid#e57 an awful price for reproductive freedom and the women they served#e58,'' she said#e59. ``They risked#e60 their lives for that freedom.''
