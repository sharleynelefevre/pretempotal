wsj_0661 Investor Group Makes @ Bid for Dataproducts; X @ Liquidation Is Sought 10/30/89 WALL STREET JOURNAL (J) DPC TENDER OFFERS, MERGERS, ACQUISITIONS (TNM) WOODLAND HILLS, Calif. DPC Acquisition is controlled by Crescott Investment Associates, Wilson Investment Group, Kernel Corp. and Catalyst Partners. The investor group owns 1,534,600 Dataproducts common shares, or a 7.6 % stake. The offer#e15 is based on several conditions, including obtaining#e84 financing#e85. DPC Acquisition said#e18 it had received#e19 the reasonable assurance of Chase Manhattan Bank N.A. that the financing#e21 can be obtained#e22. In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, DPC Acquisition said#e25 it expects#e26 it will need#e27 about $ 215 million to buy#e29 the shares and pay#e30 related fees and expenses. DPC Acquisition added#e32 that it has not begun#e33 discussions#e35 with financing sources, and said#e36 it expected#e37 to repay#e39 the amounts borrowed#e40 through proceeds of the liquidation#e42. Dataproducts officials declined#e43 to comment#e45, and said#e46 they had not yet seen#e47 a suit filed#e50 in federal court by DPC Acquisition that seeks#e52 to nullify#e54 a standstill agreement#e55 between DPC Acquisition and Dataproducts. Earlier#t86>this#t86>year#t86, DPC Acquisition made#e56 a $ 15-a-share offer#e57 for Dataproducts, which the Dataproducts board said#e58 it rejected#e59 because the $ 283.7 million offer was not fully financed#e61. Dataproducts has since started#e64 a restructuring#e88, and has said#e65 it is not for#e90 sale.
