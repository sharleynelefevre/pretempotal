Business Brief-- Oshkosh Truck Corp.: X @ Firm Says Net Fell Sharply @ In Its Fiscal Fourth Quarter 11/02/89 WALL STREET JOURNAL (J) OTRKB EARNINGS (ERN) Oshkosh Truck Corp., Oshkosh, Wis., estimated#e17 earnings for its fourth#t2027>quarter#t2027 ended Sept.#t2023>30#t2023 fell#e2 50 % to 75 % below the year-earlier $ 4.5 million, or 51 cents a share. The truck maker said#e3 the significant drop#e21 in net income will result#e4 in lower earnings for#s1 the#t2024>fiscal#t2024>year#t2024. In#s2 fiscal#t37>1988#t37, the company earned#e5 $ 17.3 million, or $ 1.92 a share, on revenue of $ 352.9 million. Oshkosh Truck attributed#e6 the downturn#e26 in its earnings to higher start-up costs of its new chassis division, a softer motor-home market and higher administrative costs of compliance with government contractor regulations. The company said#e7 it is in the process of phasing#e10 out John Deere, its current source of production for midsized motor home chassis. In anticipation of the start-up of its new factory, the company said#e11 a larger-than-normal chassis supply has been built#e12 to carry#e13 it through the transition period.
