wsj_0781 Chip by Intel @ Contains Flaw X @ In Calculating @-- X X @ ` Bugs ''Could Stall Makers @ Of Certain Computers; X @ Most Users Unaffected @-- X @ By Stephen Kreider Yoder @ Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal 10/27/89 WALL STREET JOURNAL (J) INTC IBM CPQ SEMICONDUCTORS, INTEGRATED CHIPS (SEM) COMPUTERS AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (CPR) Computer experts familiar with the flaws, found in Intel's 80486 chip, say#e10 the defects don't affect#e11 the average user and are likely to be cleared#e14 up before most computers using the chip as their ''brains ''appear#e16 on the market sometime#t278>next#t278>year#t278. Intel said#e19 that last#t279>week#t279 a customer discovered#e20 two flaws in its 80486 microprocessor chip's `` floating-point unit "",, a set of circuits that do certain calculations. On#s1 Friday#t280, Intel began#e24 notifying#e25 customers about the bugs which cause#e26 the chip to give#e28 wrong answers for some mathematical calculations. But while International Business Machines Corp. and Compaq Computer Corp. say#e32 the bugs will delay#e33 products, most big computer makers said#e34 the flaws don't affect#e35 them.`` Bugs like this are just a normal part of product development, ''said#e38 Richard Archuleta, director of Hewlett-Packard Co.'s advanced systems development. Hewlett announced#e41 last#t281>week#t281 that it planned#e42 to ship#e44 a computer based on the 486 chip early#t282>next#t282>year#t282.`` These bugs don't affect#e46 our schedule at all, ''he said#e49. Likewise, AST Research Inc. and Sun Microsystems Inc. said#e50 the bugs won't delay#e51 their development#e53 of 486-based machines.`` We haven't modified#e54 our schedules in any way, ''said#e59 a Sun spokesman. To switch#e61 to another vendor's chips, `` would not definitely be an option, ''he said#e65. Nonetheless, concern about the chip may have been responsible for a decline#e236 of 87.5 cents in Intel's stock to $ 32 a share yesterday#t283 in over-the-counter trading#e67, on volume of 3,609,800 shares, and partly responsible for a drop#e242 in Compaq's stock in New York Stock Exchange composite trading#e243 on#s2 Wednesday#t284. Yesterday#t285, Compaq plunged#e69 further, closing#e247 at $ 100 a share, off $ 8.625 a share, on volume of 2,633,700 shares. Most of Compaq's decline#e249 is being attributed#e70 to a third-quarter#t1000 earnings report that came in at the low end of analysts expectations. Intel said#e74 it had corrected#e75 the problems and would start#e76 producing#e78 bugless chips next#t286>week#t286.`` We should not be seeing#e79 any more, ''said#e82 Bill Rash, Intel's director for the 486 chip. What's more, the bugs only emerge#e83 on esoteric applications such as computer-aided UCP design and scientific calculations, he said#e88, and then very seldom.`` These errata do not affect#e90 business programs, ''he said#e92. The bugs will cause#e93 problems in `` specific and rare circumstances that will not occur in typical applications ''such as word-processing and spreadsheets, said#e99 Michael Slater, editor of the Microprocessor Report, an industry newsletter. Sun, Hewlett-Packard and others say#e102 Intel isn't wholly to blame for the snafu. The real culprits, they said#e105, are computer makers such as IBM that have jumped#e106 the gun to unveil#e108 486-based products.`` The reason this is getting so much visibility is that some started#e111 shipping#e112 and announced#e113 early availability, ''said#e114 Hewlett-Packard's Mr. Archuleta.`` You can do that but you're taking a risk. Those companies are paying the price for taking the risk. ''In late#t287>September#t287, IBM began#e122 shipping#e123 a plug-in card that converts its PS/2 model 70-A21 from a 80386 machine to an 80486 machine. An IBM spokeswoman said#e126 the company told#e127 customers Monday#t288 about the bugs and temporarily stopped#e128 shipping#e129 the product. IBM has#e130 no plans to recall#e133 its add-on cards, the spokeswoman said#e135, and could probably circumvent#e136 the bugs without long product delays#e138.`` We don't look#e139 at this as a major problem for us, ''she said#e141. Compaq, which said#e142 it discovered#e143 the bugs, still plans#e144 to announce#e146 new 486 products on#s3 Nov.#t289>6#t289. Because of the glitch, however, the company said#e147 it doesn't know#e148 when its machine will be commercially available#e262. That's a break from Compaq tradition, because the company doesn't announce products until they're actually at the dealers. The problem is being ballyhooed#e154, experts say#e155, because the 486 is Intel's future flagship. Intel's microprocessors are the chips of choice in many of today's personal computers and the 80486 microprocessor is the spearhead of the company's bid to guard that spot in the next generation of machines.`` Although these sorts of bugs are not at all uncommon, the 486 is an extremely high-profile product, ''said#e163 Mr. Slater, the newsletter editor. Intel's 80486 chip is the Corvette of Intel's microprocessors, a super-fast, super-expensive chip that only the most power-hungry computer users are likely to buy for at least several#t1001>years#t1001. Unveiled last#t291>April#t291, the chip crams 1.2 million transistors on a sliver of silicon, more than four times as many as on Intel's earlier model, 80386. Intel clocks the chip's speed at 15 million instructions per second, or MIPs. That's four times as fast as the 386. Machines using#e171 the 486 are expected#e172 to challenge#e174 higher-priced work stations and minicomputers in applications such as so-called servers, which connect groups of computers UCP together, and in computer-aided design. But while the chip's speed in processing power is dazzling, it's real strength lies in its software inheritance. The 486 is the descendant of a long series of Intel chips that began#e185 dominating#e186 the market ever since IBM picked#e188 the 16-bit 8088 chip for its first personal computer. (A 16-bit microprocessor processes 16 pieces of data at a time and is slower than newer, 32-bit chips.) Since then, Intel has cornered#e192 a large part of the market with successive generations of 16-bit and 32-bit chips, all of which can run software written for previous models. That's what will keep#e198 computer makers coming#e199 in spite of the irritation of bugs. Big personal computer makers and many makers of engineering workstations are developing#e200 486-based machines, which are expected#e201 to reach#e203 the market early#t292>next#t292>year#t292. Of the big computer makers, only Apple Computer Co. bases its machines on Motorola chips instead.`` The 486 is going to have#e210 a big impact#e273 on the industry, ''said#e213 Hewlett-Packard's Mr. Archuleta.`` It's going to be the leading edge technology in personal computers for#s4 the#t293>next#t293>few#t293>years#t293. This bug is not going to have#e220 any affect on that at all. ''Andy Zipser in Dallas contributed to this article.
