Long-term Treasury bonds ended#e11 slightly higher. The dollar rose#e13 modestly against the mark and the yen, but soared#e15 against the pound following the resignation#e17 of Britain's chancellor of the Exchequer, Nigel Lawson.

Compaq Computer nose-dived#e21 $ 8.625 a share, to $ 100, and pulled#e22 other technology issues lower after#s1 reporting#e24 lower-than-expected earnings after the stock market closed#e27 Wednesday#t99.

''The bond market was unmoved#e117 by the economic statistics. While bond investors would have preferred#e118 growth#e119 to be#e134 a little slower, they were cheered#e60 by inflation measures in the data that showed prices rising#e63 at a modest annual rate of 2.9 %. That is another small encouragement#e65 for the Federal Reserve to lower#e120 interest rates in#s5 coming#t121>weeks#t121, they reasoned#e68.
