wsj_0575 Control Data Says It May Repurchase @ Debt Soon, Seeks Alliances With Others X @-- X @ By Richard Gibson @ Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal 10/30/89 WALL STREET JOURNAL (J) CDA COMPUTERS AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (CPR) TENDER OFFERS, MERGERS, ACQUISITIONS (TNM) MINNEAPOLIS Moreover, the company, WP$, whose go-it-alone approach nearly proved#e6 fatal, now#t2041 sees#e7 alliances with others as the way back to prosperity in what it calls `` the data solutions ''business.`` I m not saying everything is hunky-dory, but we have completed#e15 the transition#e16, ''Robert M. Price, chairman and chief executive, said#e17 in an interview#e18.`` Transition ''is a reference to the company's five-year#t209 restructuring effort#e22. During#s1 that#t213>time#t213, Control Data had#e24 losses of more than $ 1 billion. Now, following asset sales that shrank#e26 revenue by more than one-third this#t2110>year#t2110 alone, Control Data is flush#e215 with cash. So its senior executives are talking#e28 openly about possibly buying#e29 back some of the company's $ 172.5 million in subordinated convertible debentures next#t218>year#t218.`` We'd like#e221 to continue#e33 to reduce#e35 debt, ''President Lawrence Perlman said#e36. Noting#e37 that the company is offering#e38 to buy#e40 back $ 154.2 million in senior notes paying#e43 12, 3/4 %, he said#e44 the response will help#e45 determine#e46 future debt-reduction efforts#e47. The offer#e48 was automatically triggered#e49 by the recent#t222 sale#e50 of Control Data's Imprimis disk-drive business to Seagate Technology Inc. He said#e63 the company has#e64 no intention of tapping#e66 its short-term bank lines `` for#s2 a#t228>good#t228>part#t228>of#t228>1990#t228. ''Sometime next#t229>year#t229, Control Data will ''develop#e68 a new bank relationship, ''Mr. Perlman said#e69. In#s3 recent#t232>months#t232 a group of lenders, led by Bank of America, has extended#e71 Control Data up to $ 90 million in revolving loans through January#t237, as well as $ 115 million in standby letters of credit. Loan covenants require that the company achieve specified levels of operating earnings and meet a rolling four-quarter profitability test. Last#t238>week#t238 Control Data reported#e80 third-quarter#t239 earnings#e240 of $ 9.8 million, or 23 cents a share, on revenue of $ 763 million. Through the#t241>first#t241>nine#t241>months#t241, the company had#e242 a loss#e81 of $ 484 million, largely reflecting the closing#e83 of its supercomputer unit. While a few assets are still being shopped-- including the sports and entertainment ticketing portion of the company's Ticketron unit-- Mr. Price said#e2338 future restructuring would be a question of strategy.`` We don't need#e91 the cash. ''Ticketron's automated wagering business, which operates lotteries in a half dozen states, is not for sale, the company said#e100. Rather, Mr. Perlman said#e101, Control Data intends#e102 to bid#e104 for the coming Minnesota lottery contract and is seeking#e105 new applications for the technology overseas, where `` there is great interest in games of skill. ''He wouldn't elaborate#e110. Control Data's semiconductor business, VTC Inc., continues#e114 to lose#e116 money, the executives acknowledged#e118, but they said#e119 they consider some of the technology vital to national defense and so are reluctant#e247 to dispose#e124 of it. The company's strategy for keeping its computer products business profitable-- it recently#t1991 achieved#e127 profitability after#s4 several#t1994>quarters#t1994 of losses#e2430-- calls for a narrow focus and a lid on expenses. Partly, costs will be held#e132 down through strategic technology alliances, management said#e2437. Control Data recently#t1995 announced#e135 an agreement#e136 with MIPS Computer Systems Inc. to jointly develop#e138 machines with simplified operating software. James E. Ousley, computer products group president, said#e140 such arrangements could help#e141 slash#e1998 Control Data's computer research and development costs in half by the#t2000>end#t2000>of#t2000>1990#t2000. He disclosed#e145 that before#s5 Control Data scrapped#e147 its ETA Systems Inc. supercomputer business this#t2001>past#t2001>spring#t2001, those costs were running#e148 at nearly 35 % of group revenue. At the same time four of six design projects were spiked#e150, he said#e151. Asked#e152 how the company hopes#e153 to expand#e155 its computer hardware business, Mr. Ousley said#e157 it sees#e158 good opportunities in systems integration.`` We think#e161 we're getting#e162 only 10 % of the integration dollars our customers are spending#e164, ''he said#e165.`` We're in environments that are going to spend#e168 a lot of money on that. ''Control Data mainframes are designed for numerically intensive computing users, such as the UCP scientific, engineering and academic communities. Utilities management is a major commercial niche. Reviewing#e173 the company's scrape#e174 with disaster, Mr. Price conceded#e176 it had tried#e177 to do#e178 too much on its own.`` Absolutely, ''he said. But while its stock is selling#e181 at about half Control Data's estimated breakup value, neither Messrs. Perlman nor Price said#e183 he spends#e184 much time considering#e186 the possibility of a hostile takeover#e187.`` We ve been listed#e188 as a candidate for so long it's not worth worrying about, ''said#e190 Mr. Price.
