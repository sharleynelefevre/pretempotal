Lehner @ Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal 10/30/89 WALL STREET JOURNAL (J) J.SNE TENDER OFFERS, MERGERS, ACQUISITIONS (TNM) HOME ELECTRONICS, FURNISHINGS, APPLIANCES (HMF) TOKYO Polly Peck International Inc.'s agreement#e1 to acquire#e3 51 % of Sansui Electric Co. proves that foreign companies can acquire Japanese companies-- if the alternative for the Japanese company is extinction. Polly Peck, a fast-growing British conglomerate, will pay#e8 15.6 billion yen ( $ 110 million) for 39 million new shares of Sansui, a well-known maker of high-fidelity audio equipment that failed#e9 to adjust#e11 to changing market conditions. Japanese government officials, eager to rebut#e14 foreign criticism#e195 of Japanese investments#e16 overseas, hailed#e17 the transaction#e18 as proof foreigners can make similar investments in Japan. Polly Peck's chairman, Asil Nadir, echoed#e22 the official Japanese view of the accord#e198, which was announced#e23 Friday#t200.`` The myths that Japan is not open to concerns from outside has, I think, been demolished#e27 at a stroke, ''Mr. Nadir said#e30. But analysts say#e31 Sansui is a special case. It expects#e33 to post#e35 a loss#e36 of 6.4 billion yen for#s1 the#t204>year#t204 ending tomorrow#t205 and its liabilities currently#t207 exceed#e39 its assets by about 13.8 billion yen.`` If you find#e246 sound, healthy companies in Japan, they are not for sale, ''said#e43 George Watanabe, a management-consultant at Tokyo-based Asia Advisory Services Inc. Statistics on acquisitions by foreigners vary in detail, because unlike Sansui, which is listed on the Tokyo and Osaka stock exchanges, most of the Japanese companies acquired#e3000 by foreigners are privately held. But by all accounts foreign companies have bought only a relative handful of Japanese companies this#t211>year#t211, while Japanese companies have acquired hundreds of foreign companies. Nor do analysts expect#e56 the Sansui deal to touch#e58 off a fresh wave of foreign purchases. If the strong yen and the high stock prices of Japanese companies weren't deterrents enough, webs of cross-shareholdings between friendly Japanese companies and fiercely independent Japanese corporate attitudes repel#e62 most would-be acquirers. Usually when a Japanese company is ready to sell, it has few alternatives remaining, and the grim demeanors of Sansui's directors at a joint news conference here left little doubt that this was not the company's finest hour. Sansui was once one of Japan's premier makers of expensive, high-quality stereo gear for audiophiles. But in#s2 recent#t216>years#t216, the market has moved#e71 toward less expensive `` mini-component ''sets, miniaturized NX NX amplifiers and NX receivers and NX software players that could be stacked on top of each other. Some of Sansui's fellow audio-specialty companies, such as Aiwa Co. and Pioneer Electric Corp., responded#e75 to the challenge#e76 by quickly bringing#e77 out mini-component products of their own, by moving#e78 heavily into the booming compact disk businesses or by diversifying#e81 into other consumer-electronics fields, including laser disks or portable cassette players. Sansui was late into the mini-component business and failed#e85 to branch#e87 into other new businesses. As the yen soared#e90 in#s3 recent#t217>years#t217, Sansui's deepening financial problems became#e92 a vicious circle. While competitors moved#e93 production offshore in response to the sagging competitiveness of Japanese factories, Sansui lacked#e95 the money to build#e98 new plants in Southeast Asia.`` Our company has not been able#e224 to cope#e225 very effectively with ''changes#e102 in the marketplace, said#e105 Ryosuke Ito, Sansui's president. But even a Japanese company that looks like a dog may turn out to be a good investment for a foreign concern, some management consultants maintain. Yoshihisa Murasawa, a management consultant for Booz-Allen amp Hamilton (Japan) Inc., said#e113 his firm will likely be recommending#e115 acquisitions#e116 of Japanese companies more often to foreign clients in#s4 the#t228>future#t228.`` Attitudes -LCB- toward being acquired -RCB- are still negative, but they're becoming#e119 more positive, ''Mr. Murasawa said#e120.`` In some industries, like pharmaceuticals, acquisitions make#e249 sense. ''Whether Polly Peck's acquisition#e125 makes#e248 sense remains#e233 to be seen#e130, but at the news conference, Mr. Nadir brimmed#e131 with self-confidence that he can turn#e132 Sansui around. Sansui, he said#e3001, is a perfect fit for Polly Peck's electronics operations, which make televisions, videocassette recorders, microwaves and other products on an `` original equipment maker ''basis for sale under other companies brand names. He said Polly Peck will greatly expand#e141 Sansui's product line, using Sansui's engineers to design#e145 the new products, and will move#e146 Sansui's production of most products other than sophisticated audio gear offshore into Polly Peck's own factories.`` Whatever capital it (Sansui) needs so it can compete#e149 and become#e151 a totally global entity capable of competing with the best in the world, that capital will be injected#e153, ''Mr. Nadir said#e154. And while Polly Peck isn't jettisoning#e156 the existent top-management structure of Sansui, it is bringing#e158 in a former Toshiba Corp. executive as executive NX NX vice president and NX chief operating officer. Such risk taking is an everyday matter for the brash Mr. Nadir, who is 25 % owner of Polly Peck as well as its chairman. He took#e162 Polly Peck, once a small fabric wholesaler, and used#e163 it at as a base to build#e165 a conglomerate that has been doubling#e166 its profits annually since#s5 1980#t235. In#s6 September#t239, it announced#e167 plans#e240 to acquire#e169 the tropical-fruit business of RJR Nabisco Inc.'s Del Monte foods unit for 557 million ( $ 878 million). Last#t241>month#t241, Polly Peck posted#e171 a 38 % jump#e172 in pretax profit for the first half to 54.8 million from 39.8 million on a 63 % rise#e174 in sales. Joann S.
