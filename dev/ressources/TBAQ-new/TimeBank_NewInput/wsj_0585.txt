wsj_0585 OTC Focus: @ Sell Programs @ Are Hurting @ Market Makers @-- X @ By Sonja Steptoe and Craig Smith @ Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal 10/30/89 WALL STREET JOURNAL (J) STOCK MARKET, OFFERINGS (STK) STOCK INDEXES (NDX) SECURITIES INDUSTRY (SCR) NEW YORK Their motivation, however, has a strong practical aspect: Program trading is hazardous to their paychecks. The most controversial form of program trading, stock-index arbitrage, is ''making#e298 it tough for traders to make money, ''declares#e297 Robert Antolini, head of OTC trading at Donaldson, Lufkin amp Jenrette. Stock-index arbitrage#e17-- the computer-guided buying and selling of stocks with offsetting trades in stock-index futures to profit from fleeting price discrepancies-- affects#e25 the OTC market directly through the 31 stocks included in Standard amp Poor's 500-stock index. The SampP 500 is often used in arbitrage strategies. The portion of OTC volume attributable to program trading isn't known, as it is on the New York Stock Exchange, where it amounted#e34 to more than 13 % in#s1 September#t295. Estimates#e35 from traders put it at less than 5 % of Nasdaq's average daily volume of roughly 133 million shares. Other market-maker gripes: Program trading#e38 also causes#e39 the Nasdaq Composite Index to lose#e41 ground against other segments of the stock market. Because of program trading#e43 it is more difficult#e299 to trade#e45 many OTC stocks without sharp price moves#e46, a condition known as illiquidity. Moreover, the price volatility#e302 that is amplified#e48 by program trading#e49 is undercutting#e50 efforts#e51 to woo#e53 individual investors back to an OTC market that sorely misses#e55 them. Some of these problems#e547 are neither new nor unique to the OTC market. But the big, often tumultuous slide#e57 in stock prices this#t303>month#t303 has turned#e58 some of those who have been profiting#e59 from the practice against it. Peter DaPuzzo, head of retail equity trading at Shearson Lehman Hutton, acknowledges#e63 that he wasn't troubled#e305 by program trading#e64 when it began#e66 in the pre-crash bull market because it added#e69 liquidity and people were pleased#e308 to see#e71 stock prices rising#e72.`` We weren't as concerned until they became#e75 sell programs, ''says#e76 Mr. DaPuzzo, who now#t311 thinks#e77 it adds#e78 unnecessary volatility. Shearson Lehman, however, executes program trades for clients. Merrill Lynch, Goldman Sachs and Kidder Peabody, in addition to Shearson, do program-trade OTC stocks. Shearson, Merrill Lynch and Goldman Sachs say they do so only for customers, however. Kidder Peabody does program trading for its own as well as clients NX accounts. Of course, there were sell programs#e318 in#s2 past#t320>years#t320, too, but they seem#e90 to hurt#e92 market makers more painfully these#t321>days#t321. That's largely because of defensive measures they adopted#e94 after#s3 the 1987#t323 crash#e95, when individual investors fled#e98 the market and trading activity dwindled#e101. Market makers, to cut#e103 costs, slashed#e104 inventories of stocks they keep on hand to sell investors when other holders aren't selling. And to protect#e114 their reduced capital investment from eroding#e117 further, market makers became quicker to lower#e324 price quotes when sell programs are in#e1093 progress. On days when prices are tumbling, they must be willing#e326 to buy#e127 shares from sellers when no one else will. In such an environment, market makers can suffer#e130 huge losses#e327 both on trades made that day at steadily dropping prices and in the value of their inventories of shares.`` It makes#e329 no sense#e140 for us to put#e142 money at risk when you know#e147 you're going to lose, ''says#e151 Mr. Antolini, of Donaldson Lufkin. But this skittishness#e330, Mr. Antolini says, is creating#e153 liquidity problems#e331 in certain OTC stocks.`` It's harder to sell stocks when the sell programs come in because some market makers don't want to -LCB- take the orders -RCB-. No one has big positions and no one wants to take big risks. ''Joseph Hardiman, president of the National Association of Securities Dealers, which oversees trading on Nasdaq, agrees#e171 that program trading is hurting#e173 the market's efforts#e175 to bring#e177 back small investors. But, he observes#e178, while makers suffer#e180 losses#e333 when program trading drags#e184 the market down, they also make#e185 money when program trading pushes#e190 the prices higher.`` Sometimes -LCB- traders -RCB- lose#e191 sight of that, ''he says#e193. The OTC stocks in the SampP 500 include Nasdaq's biggest, such as Apple Computer, MCI Communications, Tele-Communications and Liz Claiborne. These big stocks greatly influence the Nasdaq Composite Index. When the computers say `` sell, ''the composite tumbles as well as the Dow Jones Industrial Average. The problem, market makers say, is that while the industrial average and the SampP 500 usually recover as buy programs kick in, the Nasdaq Composite frequently is left behind. Eight#t336>trading#t336>days#t336 after#s4 Oct.#t335>12#t335, the#t338>day#t338 before#s5 the stock market plunge#e205, for instance, the Nasdaq Composite had fallen#e208 4.3 %, compared with 3.3 % for the SampP 500, 3.5 % for the New York Stock Exchange Composite Index and 3.6 % for the industrial average. This gap eventually closes#e210, but slowly. Three#t341>days#t341 later#s6, as of Friday#t340's close#e211, the Nasdaq Composite was down 6 %, compared with 5.9 % for the industrial average, 5.7 % for the SampP 500 and 5.8 % for the Big Board Composite. The main reason for this lag#e214 is that individual investors own#e345 65 % of the OTC market's capitalization, according#e346 to Mr. Hardiman, much more than on the Big Board. Such investors tend to be more cautious than institutional investors are about re-entering the market after massive selloffs, market makers say. The Nasdaq Composite Index tumbled#e223 5.39, or 1.2 % to 452.76 on#s7 Friday#t356. For#s8 the#t357>week#t357, the index dropped#e225 3.8 %. Weakness#e358 in big technology stocks hurt#e227 the composite as well as the Nasdaq 100 Index, which fell#e228 1.4 %, or 6.43, on#s9 Friday#t362, to 437.68. The Nasdaq Financial Index lost#e229 about 1 %, or 3.95, to 448.80. Friday#t365's trading volume totaled#e230 132.8 million shares. The average daily share turnover for#s10 October#t366 is almost 148 million shares. LIN Broadcasting surged#e231 4, 5/8 to 112, 5/8; LIN and BellSouth sweetened#e232 their merger agreement in an attempt#e234 to keep#e237 shareholders from tendering#e239 their shares to McCaw Cellular Communications. McCaw, which dropped#e240 2, 1/2 to 37, 3/4, has offered#e241 $ 125 a share for a majority of LIN's shares. The revised LIN-BellSouth agreement boosts#e243 the dollar amount of the special dividend LIN promises to pay shareholders. LIN now#t368 plans#e247 to dole#e249 out $ 42 a share in cash, up from the earlier $ 20 amount. Intel eased#e252 1/8 to 31, 7/8. The semiconductor concern said#e253 the interruption#e254 in shipment#e371 of its 80486 computer chip will be brief#e372 and have#e373 little impact#e256 on the company's earnings. The stock fell#e257 7/8 Thursday#t1082 amid concerns#e1085 over problems discovered with the chip. Intel told#e259 analysts that the company will resume#e260 shipments#e261 of the chips within two#t1111>to#t1111>three#t1111>weeks#t1111. Weisfield's rocketed#e262 9, 1/2 to 39 after the jewelry store operator said#e263 it is in preliminary discussions#e1091, with a party it wouldn't identify#e267, regarding the possible acquisition#e271 of the company. Starpointe Savings Bank rose#e272 3 to 20 after the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. approved#e273 Dime Savings Bank of New York's $ 21-a-share acquisition#e274 of Starpointe. Kirschner Medical fell#e275 4 to 15. The company said#e276 its third-quarter#t380 earnings will probably be lower#e381 than the 16 cents a share it reported#e277 last#t387>year#t387, despite a rise#e278 in the company's revenue. Kirschner earned#e279 $ 376,000 on revenue of $ 14.5 million in#s11 the#t386>1988#t386>quarter#t386. The company blamed#e280 a number of factors for the earnings decline#e390, including softer sales#e392 of joint-implants.
