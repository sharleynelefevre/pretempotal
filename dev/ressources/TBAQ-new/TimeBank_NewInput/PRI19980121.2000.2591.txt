PRI19980121.2000.2591 We're off in search#e2 of an ancient and exotic city. An officially sanctioned#e4 one, too. UNESCO declared#e5 it a protected site for its beauty and its historical significance. The city could have used#e6 some special protection in#s1 nineteen#t34>seventy-nine#t34 when the Soviet Union invaded#e10 Afghanistan. Most of the city's monuments were destroyed#e11, including a magnificent tiled mosque, which dominated#e12 the skyline for#s2 centuries#t1982. The people here are famous throughout central Asia for their skill in fashioning pottery and tile, glass too. Some families have kept#e1989 their glass working secrets for#s3 more#t1991>than#t1991>two#t1991>thousand#t1991>years#t1991. Even though this city is in Afghanistan, most people here speak#e19 a dialect of the Persian language, and have#e22 long standing cultural ties with neighboring Iran. Think#e25 you got#e26 it? Well, frankly, I do nt, but the answer is coming#e30 up in just a#t1986>few#t1986>minutes#t1986.
