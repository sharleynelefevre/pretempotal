Steve Hurst has that. The US military buildup#e103 in the Persian gulf continues#e6 apace, more planes headed#e7 from the united states and senior officials say#e9 Iraq's president Saddam Hussein can expect#e10 punishing air strikes#e13 to continue#e15 well into the#t105>future#t105 if he doesn't stop#e17 building#e19 biological and chemical weapons. Saddam will know#e21 by our actions#e22 and our warning#e23 that we will be prepared#e24 to act#e26 again if we have evidence he is trying#e29 to rebuild#e31 his weapons of mass destruction capabilities. In a bit of television diplomacy, Iraq's deputy foreign minister responded#e34 from Baghdad in#s1 less#t111>than#t111>one#t111>hour#t111, saying#e35 Washington would break#e36 international law by attacking#e39 without UN approval#e113. The united states is not authorized#e40 to use#e43 force before#s2 going#e45 to the council. President Clinton, meantime, glossed#e46 over stern warnings#e47 from Moscow on#s3 Thursday#t116 that US air strikes#e117 against Iraq could do#e118 serious harm to relations with the Kremlin. We're trying#e52 to find#e54 a diplomatic solution. And I hope#e56 that, whatever happens#e57 today#t119, that our relationships with Russia will continue#e58 to be productive and constructive and strong, because that's very important to the future of our peoples. One contrary view of the issue presented#e60 itself to the president as he arrived#e61 in Philadelphia later in#s4 the#t126>day#t126. Nevertheless, the president said#e62 Washington would use#e63 force if diplomacy fails#e67 to force#e128 Saddam Hussein to back#e129 down. The Russian foreign minister, meanwhile, sought#e68 to soften#e70 the harsh words of his military counterpart, saying#e72 on#s5 Friday#t133 that Russia now#t135 feels#e73 the US must hold#e74 off at least until UN secretary general Kofi Annan visits#e137 Baghdad in a last-ditch effort at diplomacy. Annan has no trip#e78 planned#e141 so far. Meanwhile, secretary of state Madeleine Albright, Berger and defense secretary William Cohen announced#e80 plans#e144 to travel#e82 to an unnamed city in the US heartland next#t145>week#t145, to explain#e84 to the American people just why military force will be necessary#e146 if diplomacy fails#e87.
