PRI19980115.2000.0186 A federal appeals court has reinstated#e3 his state convictions#e1998 for securities fraud#e2000. NPR's Elaine Corey has more from San Francisco. In#s1 nineteen#t30>ninety-one#t30 Charles Keating was convicted#e5 in state court of helping#e7 to defraud#e8 thousands of investors who bought#e9 high risk junk bonds sold#e10 by Keating's employees at Lincoln savings and loan. The bonds became#e11 worthless when the bankrupt thrift was seized#e13 by government regulators. Keating's convictions#e2003 were thrown#e14 out in#s2 nineteen#t31>ninety-six#t31 on a technicality. And on that basis Keating was released#e15 from prison before#s3 he was eligible#e2004 for parole#e2008. Now#t32 the ninth US circuit court of appeals has ruled#e17 that the original appeal#e2007 was flawed#e18 since it brought#e19 up issues that had not been raised#e20 before. That means#e22 the convictions stand#e23, a ruling#e2039 likely to send#e24 Keating's lawyers back to state court where they must start#e2010 over with a new appeal#e2011.
