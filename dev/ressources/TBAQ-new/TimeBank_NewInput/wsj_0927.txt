Areddy X X @ Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal 10/26/89 WALL STREET JOURNAL (J) USTC WNEWS NEW YORK H. Marshall Schwarz was named#e1 NX NX chairman and NX chief executive officer of U.S. Trust Corp., a private-banking firm with assets under management of about $ 17 billion. Mr. Schwarz, 52 years old, will succeed#e3 Daniel P. Davison Feb.#t89>1#t89, soon after#s1 Mr. Davison reaches#e4 the company's mandatory retirement age of 65. Mr. Schwarz, who is president of U.S. Trust, will be succeeded#e5 in that post by Jeffrey S. Maurer, 42, who is executive vice president in charge of the company's asset-management group. U.S. Trust, a 136-year-old institution that is one of the earliest high-net worth banks in the U.S., has faced#e8 intensifying competition from other firms that have established#e12, and heavily promoted#e13, private-banking businesses of their own. As a result, U.S. Trust's earnings have been hurt#e16. But Mr. Schwarz welcomes#e17 the competition in U.S. Trust's flagship businesses, calling#e93 it `` flattery. ''Mr. Schwarz says#e22 the competition `` broadens#e24 the base of opportunity for us. ''Other firms `` are dealing#e25 with the masses. I don't believe#e26 they have#e28 the culture ''to adequately service#e29 high-net-worth individuals, he adds#e30. U.S. Trust recently#t95 introduced#e31 certain mutual-fund products, which allow it to serve customers with minimum deposits of $ 250,000. Previously, the company advertised#e35 at the $ 2 million level.`` We have always taken#e37 smaller accounts, but now#t97 we are looking#e39 for smaller accounts that will grow, ''Mr. Schwarz says#e42.`` Our bread and butter is still the $ 2 million to $ 20 million account, ''he says#e2136. The new services allow#e47 U.S. Trust to cater#e49 to the `` new wealth, ''Mr. Schwarz says#e50. Quarterly#t98 net income this#t99>year#t99 has risen#e51 just over comparable periods in#s2 1988#t104, when year-end net was below#e2372 the 1987#t2194 level. In#s3 this#t111>year's#t111>third#t111>quarter#t111, for example, net was $ 10.5 million, or $ 1.05 a share, compared with $ 10.3 million, or $ 1.02 a share, a#t112>year#t112>earlier#t112. Assets as of Sept.#t113>30#t113 fell#e54 to $ 2.46 billion from about $ 2.77 billion.`` We will have#e55 a reasonably flat year this#t122>year#t122, ''Mr. Schwarz says#e56. Mr. Schwarz also said#e57 costs associated with U.S. Trust's planned move to midtown Manhattan from Wall Street will continue#e60 to be a drag#e2370 on earnings through 1990#t116. Mr. Schwarz's great-grandfather founded#e62 the New York toy store F.A.O. Schwarz, but his family no longer has#e64 ties to the company. Mr. Schwarz's father was a U.S. Trust trustee#e2371 until#s4 1974#t127. U.S. Trust also created#e65 a four-member office of the chairman, effective Feb.#t131>1#t131. It will include Messrs. Schwarz and Maurer. Donald M. Roberts, 54, treasurer, and Frederick S. Wonham, 58, who takes responsibility for the funds-service group, were named#e69 vice chairmen and will serve#e71 in the office of the chairman. Mr. Roberts continues#e72 as treasurer#e132, and Mr. Wonham remains#e73 responsible#e133 for the offices of comptroller, planning, marketing and general services. Frederick B. Taylor, 48, also was named#e77 a NX NX vice chairman and NX chief investment officer#e135, a new post. He previously held#e2364 similar responsibilities. Mr. Taylor also was named#e80 a director#e136, increasing#e137 the board to 22, but is not part of the new office of the chairman. James E. Bacon, 58, executive vice president, who has directed#e84 the funds-service group, will retire#e85.
